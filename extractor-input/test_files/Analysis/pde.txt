Introduction

Ordinary and partial differential equations occur in many applications. An

ordinary differential equation is a special case of a partial differential equa-

tion but the behaviour of solutions is quite different in general. It is much

more complicated in the case of partial differential equations caused by the

fact that the functions for which we are looking at are functions of more

than one independent variable.

Equation

F (x, y(x), y (x), . . . , y(n)) = 0

is an ordinary differential equation of n-th order for the unknown function y(x), where F is given.
An important problem for ordinary differential equations is the initial value problem

y (x) = f (x, y(x)) y(x0) = y0 ,

where f is a given real function of two variables x, y and x0, y0 are given real numbers.

Picard-Lindelo¨f Theorem. Suppose (i) f (x, y) is continuous in a rectangle
Q = {(x, y)  R2 : |x - x0| < a, |y - y0| < b}. (ii) There is a constant K such that |f (x, y)|  K for all (x, y)  Q. (ii) Lipschitz condition: There is a constant L such that
|f (x, y2) - f (x, y1)|  L|y2 - y1|

for all (x, y1), (x, y2).
Then there exists a unique solution y  C1(x0 -, x0 +) of the above initial value problem, where  = min(b/K, a).
The linear ordinary differential equation y(n) + an-1(x)y(n-1) + . . . a1(x)y + a0(x)y = 0,
where aj are continuous functions, has exactly n linearly independent solutions. In contrast to this property the partial differential uxx +uyy = 0 in R2 has infinitely many linearly independent solutions in the linear space C2(R2).
The ordinary differential equation of second order y (x) = f (x, y(x), y (x))
has in general a family of solutions with two free parameters. Thus, it is naturally to consider the associated initial value problem
y (x) = f (x, y(x), y (x)) y(x0) = y0, y (x0) = y1, where y0 and y1 are given, or to consider the boundary value problem y (x) = f (x, y(x), y (x)) y(x0) = y0, y(x1) = y1. Initial and boundary value problems play an important role also in the theory of partial differential equations. A partial differential equation for

the unknown function u(x, y) is for example
F (x, y, u, ux, uy, uxx, uxy, uyy) = 0,
where the function F is given. This equation is of second order. An equation is said to be of n-th order if the highest derivative which
occurs is of order n. An equation is said to be linear if the unknown function and its deriva-
tives are linear in F . For example,
a(x, y)ux + b(x, y)uy + c(x, y)u = f (x, y),
where the functions a, b, c and f are given, is a linear equation of first order.
An equation is said to be quasilinear if it is linear in the highest derivatives. For example,
a(x, y, u, ux, uy)uxx + b(x, y, u, ux, uy)uxy + c(x, y, u, ux, uy)uyy = 0
is a quasilinear equation of second order.

1.1 Examples

1. uy = 0, where u = u(x, y). All functions u = w(x) are solutions.

2. ux = uy, where u = u(x, y). A change of coordinates transforms this equation into an equation of the first example. Set  = x + y,  = x - y,

then

u(x, y) = u

Assume u  C1, then

uy ).

If ux = uy, then v = 0 and vice versa, thus v = w() are solutions for arbitrary C1-functions w(). Consequently, we have a large class of solutions

of the original partial differential equation: u = w(x + y) with an arbitrary C1-function w.

3. A necessary and sufficient condition such that for given C1-functions

M, N the integral

is independent of the curve which connects the points P0 with P1 in a simply connected domain   R2 is the partial differential equation (condition of

This is one equation for two functions. A large class of solutions is given by M = x, N = y, where (x, y) is an arbitrary C2-function. It follows from Gauss theorem that these are all C1-solutions of the above differential equation.

M (x, y)dx + N (x, y)dy = 0

for given C1-functions M, N . Then we seek a C1-function µ(x, y) such that µM dx + µN dy is a total differential, i. e., that (µM )y = (µN )x is satisfied. This is a linear partial differential equation of first order for µ:
M µy - N µx = µ(Nx - My).

5. Two C1-functions u(x, y) and v(x, y) are said to be functionally dependent

if

det

ux uy vx vy

= 0,

which is a linear partial differential equation of first order for u if v is a given C1-function. A large class of solutions is given by

u = H(v(x, y)),

where H is an arbitrary C1-function.

6. Cauchy-Riemann equations. Set f (z) = u(x, y)+iv(x, y), where z = x+iy and u, v are given C1()-functions. Here is  a domain in R2. If the function
f (z) is differentiable with respect to the complex variable z then u, v satisfy
the Cauchy-Riemann equations

ux = vy, uy = -vx.

It is known from the theory of functions of one complex variable that the real part u and the imaginary part v of a differentiable function f (z) are solutions of the Laplace equation

u = 0, v = 0,

where u = uxx + uyy.

7. The Newton potential

u=

x2 + y2 + z2

is a solution of the Laplace equation in R3 \ (0, 0, 0), i. e., of

uxx + uyy + uzz = 0.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

8. Heat equation. Let u(x, t) be the temperature of a point x   at time t, where   R3 is a domain. Then u(x, t) satisfies in  × [0, ) the heat equation
ut = k u, where u = ux1x1 +ux2x2 +ux3x3 and k is a positive constant. The condition
u(x, 0) = u0(x), x  ,
where u0(x) is given, is an initial condition associated to the above heat equation. The condition
u(x, t) = h(x, t), x  , t  0,
where h(x, t) is given is a boundary condition for the heat equation. If h(x, t) = g(x), that is, h is independent of t, then one expects that the
solution u(x, t) tends to a function v(x) if t  . Moreover, it turns out that v is the solution of the boundary value problem for the Laplace equation
v = 0 in  v = g(x) on .

utt = c2 u,

where u = u(x, t), c is a positive constant, describes oscillations of mem-

branes or of three dimensional domains, for example. In the one-dimensional

case

utt = c2uxx

describes oscillations of a string.

Associated initial conditions are
u(x, 0) = u0(x), ut(x, 0) = u1(x),
where u0, u1 are given functions. Thus the initial position and the initial velocity are prescribed.
If the string is finite one describes additionally boundary conditions, for example
u(0, t) = 0, u(l, t) = 0 for all t  0.

1.2 Equations from variational problems
A large class of ordinary and partial differential equations arise from variational problems.

Proof. Exercise. Hint: Extend the above fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations to the case of multiple integrals. The interval (x0 - , x0 + ) in the definition of  must be replaced by a ball with center at x0 and radius .

Example: Dirichlet integral

In two dimensions the Dirichlet integral is given by

D(v) =

vx2 + vy2 dxdy



and the associated Euler equation is the Laplace equation u = 0 in . Thus, there is natural relationship between the boundary value problem

u = 0 in , u = h on 

and the variational problem

min D(v).
vV
But these problems are not equivalent in general. It can happen that the boundary value problem has a solution but the variational problem has no solution, see for an example Courant and Hilbert [4], Vol. 1, p. 155, where h is a continuous function and the associated solution u of the boundary value problem has no finite Dirichlet integral.
The problems are equivalent, provided the given boundary value function h is in the class H1/2(), see Lions and Magenes [14].

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

1 + vx21 + vx22 dx,

where for a given function h defined on the boundary of the domain 

V = {v  C1() : v = h on }.

(1.1)

In fact, the additional assumption u  C2() is superfluous since it follows from regularity considerations for quasilinear elliptic equations of second order, see for example Gilbarg and Trudinger [9].
Let  = R2. Each linear function is a solution of the minimal surface equation (1.1). It was shown by Bernstein [2] that there are no other solutions of the minimal surface quation. This is true also for higher dimensions

n  7, see Simons [19]. If n  8, then there exists also other solutions which define cones, see Bombieri, De Giorgi and Giusti [3].
The linearized minimal surface equation over u  0 is the Laplace equation u = 0. In R2 linear functions are solutions but also many other functions in contrast to the minimal surface equation. This striking difference is caused by the strong nonlinearity of the minimal surface equation.
More general minimal surfaces are described by using parametric representations. An example is shown in Figure 1.71. See [18], pp. 62, for example, for rotationally symmetric minimal surfaces.

where we use the abbreviation Tu =

The above problem describes the ascent of a liquid, water for example, in a vertical cylinder with cross section . Assume the gravity is directed downwards in the direction of the negative x3-axis. Figure 1.8 shows that liquid can rise along a vertical wedge which is a consequence of the strong nonlinearity of the underlying equations, see Finn [7]. This photo was taken

Equations of first order

For a given sufficiently regular function F the general equation of first order for the unknown function u(x) is

F (x, u, u) = 0

in   Rn. The main tool for studying related problems is the theory of

ordinary differential equations. This is quite different for systems of partial

differential of first order.

The general linear partial differential equation of first order can be writ-

ten as

n

ai(x)uxi + c(x)u = f (x)

i=1

for given functions ai, c and f . The general quasilinear partial differential equation of first order is

n
ai(x, u)uxi + c(x, u) = 0.

Set p = ux(x, y), q = uy(x, y) and z = u(x, y). The tuple (x, y, z, p, q) is called surface element and the tuple (x, y, z) support of the surface element. The tangential plane is defined by the surface element. On the other hand, differential equation (2.1)

a1(x, y)p + a2(x, y)q = 0

defines at each support (x, y, z) a bundle of planes if we consider all (p, q) satisfying this equation. For fixed (x, y), this family of planes () = (; x, y) is defined by a one parameter family of ascents p() = p(; x, y), q() = q(; x, y). The envelope of these planes is a line since

a1(x, y)p() + a2(x, y)q() = 0,

which implies that the normal N() on () is perpendicular on (a1, a2, 0). Consider a curve x( ) = (x( ), y( ), z( )) on S, let Tx0 be the tangential
plane at x0 = (x(0), y(0), z(0)) of S and consider on Tx0 the line
L : l() = x0 + x (0),   R,

see Figure 2.1.
We assume L coincides with the envelope, which is a line here, of the family of planes () at (x, y, z). Assume that Tx0 = (0) and consider two planes

(0) : z - z0 = (x - x0)p(0) + (y - y0)q(0) (0 + h) : z - z0 = (x - x0)p(0 + h) + (y - y0)q(0 + h).

At the intersection l() we have

(x - x0)p(0) + (y - y0)q(0) = (x - x0)p(0 + h) + (y - y0)q(0 + h).

Thus,

x (0)p (0) + y (0)q (0) = 0.

From the differential equation

a1(x(0), y(0))p() + a2(x(0), y(0))q() = 0

It follows x (t) = a1(x, y), y (t) = a2(x, y). We denote x( (t)) by x(t) again. Now we consider the initial value problem

x (t) = a1(x, y), y (t) = a2(x, y), x(0) = x0, y(0) = y0. (2.2)

From the theory of ordinary differential equations it follows (Theorem of
Picard-Lindel¨of) that there is a unique solution in a neighbouhood of t = 0 provided the functions a1, a2 are in C1. From this definition of the curves

28

CHAPTER 2. EQUATIONS OF FIRST ORDER

(x(t), y(t)) is follows that the field of directions (a1(x0, y0), a2(x0, y0)) defines the slope of these curves at (x(0), y(0)).
Definition. The differential equations in (2.2) are called characteristic equations or characteristic system and solutions of the associated initial value problem are called characteristic curves.
Definition. A function (x, y) is said to be an integral of the characteristic system if (x(t), y(t)) = const. for each characteristic curve. The constant depends on the characteristic curve considered.

Proposition 2.1. Assume   C1 is an integral, then u = (x, y) is a solution of (2.1).
Proof. Consider for given (x0, y0) the above initial value problem (2.2). Since (x(t), y(t)) = const. it follows
xx + yy = 0 for |t| < t0, t0 > 0 and sufficiently small. Thus
x(x0, y0)a1(x0, y0) + y(x0, y0)a2(x0, y0) = 0.

Remark. If (x, y) is a solution of equation (2.1) then also H((x, y)), where H(s) is a given C1-function.
Examples

1. Consider

a1ux + a2uy = 0,

where a1, a2 are constants. The system of characteristic equations is

x = a1, y = a2.

Thus the characteristic curves are parallel straight lines defined by

x = a1t + A, y = a2t + B,

2.1. LINEAR EQUATIONS

29

where A, B are arbitrary constants. From these equations it follows that

(x, y) := a2x - a1y

is constant along each characteristic curve. Consequently, see Proposition 2.1, u = a2x - a1y is a solution of the differential equation. From an exercise it follows that

u = H(a2x - a1y),

(2.3)

where H(s) is an arbitrary C1-function, is also a solution. Since u is constant when a2x - a1y is constant, equation (2.3) defines cylinder surfaces which are generated by parallel straight lines which are parallel to the (x, y)-plane, see Figure 2.2.

CHAPTER 2. EQUATIONS OF FIRST ORDER

and the characteristic curves are given by
x = Aet, y = Bet,
where A, B are arbitrary constants. Thus, an integral is y/x, x = 0, and for a given C1-function the function u = H(x/y) is a solution of the differential equation. If y/x = const., then u is constant. Suppose that H (s) > 0, for example, then u defines right helicoids (in German: Wendelfl¨achen), see Figure 2.3

Figure 2.3: Right helicoid, a2 < x2 + y2 < R2 (Museo Ideale Leonardo da Vinci, Italy)

3. Consider the differential equation

yux - xuy = 0.

The associated characteristic system is

x = y, y = -x.

If follows

which implies that x2 + y2 = const. along each characteristic. Thus, rota-

tionally symmetric surfaces defined by u = H(x2 + y2), where H = 0, are

solutions of the differential equation.

4. The associated characteristic equations to

ayux + bxuy = 0,

where a, b are positive constants, are given by

x = ay, y = bx.

It follows bxx - ayy = 0, or equivalently,

d dt

Solutions of the differential equation are u = H(bx2 - ay2), which define

surfaces which have a hyperbola as the intersection with planes parallel to the (x, y)-plane. Here H(s) is an arbitrary C1-function, H (s) = 0.

2.2 Quasilinear equations
Here we consider the equation a1(x, y, u)ux + a2(x, y, u)uy = a3(x, y, u).
The inhomogeneous linear equation a1(x, y)ux + a2(x, y)uy = a3(x, y)
is a special case of (2.4).

(2.4)

One arrives at characteristic equations x = a1, y = a2, z = a3 from (2.4) by the same arguments as in the case of homogeneous linear equations in two variables. The additional equation z = a3 follows from
z ( ) = p()x ( ) + q()y ( ) = pa1 + qa2 = a3,
see also Section 2.3, where the general case of nonlinear equations in two variables is considered.

32

CHAPTER 2. EQUATIONS OF FIRST ORDER

2.2.1 A linearization method

We can transform the inhomogeneous equation (2.4) into a homogeneous linear equation for an unknown function of three variables by the following trick.
We are looking for a function (x, y, u) such that the solution u = u(x, y) of (2.4) is defined implicitly by (x, y, u) = const. Assume there is such a function  and let u be a solution of (2.4), then

x + uux = 0, y + uuy = 0.

Assume u = 0, then

ux

=

-

x u

,

uy

=

-

y u

.

From (2.4) we obtain

a1(x, y, z)x + a2(x, y, z)y + a3(x, y, z)z = 0,

(2.5)

where z := u. We consider the associated system of characteristic equations

x (t) = a1(x, y, z) y (t) = a2(x, y, z) z (t) = a3(x, y, z).

One arrives at this system by the same arguments as in the two-dimensional case above.

Proposition 2.2. (i) Assume w  C1, w = w(x, y, z), is an integral, i. e., it is constant along each fixed solution of (2.5), then  = w(x, y, z) is a solution of (2.5). (ii) The function z = u(x, y), implicitly defined through (x, u, z) = const., is a solution of (2.4), provided that z = 0. (iii) Let z = u(x, y) be a solution of (2.4) and let (x(t), y(t)) be a solution of
x (t) = a1(x, y, u(x, y)), y (t) = a2(x, y, u(x, y)),
then z(t) := u(x(t), y(t)) satisfies the third of the above characteristic equations.

Proof. Exercise.

2.2.2 Initial value problem of Cauchy

Consider again the quasilinear equation

()

a1(x, y, u)ux + a2(x, y, u)uy = a3(x, y, u).

Let

be a regular curve in R3 and denote by C the orthogonal projection of  onto the (x, y)-plane, i. e.,

C : x = x0(s), y = y0(s).

Initial value problem of Cauchy: Find a C1-solution u = u(x, y) of ( ) such that u(x0(s), y0(s)) = z0(s), i. e., we seek a surface S defined by z = u(x, y) which contains the curve .

Definition. The curve  is said to be noncharacteristic if x0(s)a2(x0(s), y0(s)) - y0(s)a1(x0(s), y0(s)) = 0.
Theorem 2.1. Assume a1, a2, a2  C1 in their arguments, the initial data x0, y0, z0  C1[s1, s2] and  is noncharacteristic.

34

CHAPTER 2. EQUATIONS OF FIRST ORDER

Then there is a neighbourhood of C such that there exists exactly one solution u of the Cauchy initial value problem.

Proof. (i) Existence. Consider the following initial value problem for the system of characteristic equations to ( ):

x (t) = a1(x, y, z) y (t) = a2(x, y, z) z (t) = a3(x, y, z)
with the initial conditions

x(s, 0) = x0(s) y(s, 0) = y0(s) z(s, 0) = z0(s).

Let x = x(s, t), y = y(s, t), z = z(s, t) be the solution, s1  s  s2, |t| <  for an  > 0. We will show that this set of strings sticked onto the curve , see Figure 2.4, defines a surface. To show this, we consider the inverse functions s = s(x, y), t = t(x, y) of x = x(s, t), y = y(s, t) and show that z(s(x, y), t(x, y)) is a solution of the initial problem of Cauchy. The inverse functions s and t exist in a neighbourhood of t = 0 since

det

t=0

=

xs ys

xt yt

= x0(s)a2 - y0(s)a1 = 0,
t=0

and the initial curve  is noncharacteristic by assumption. Set u(x, y) := z(s(x, y), t(x, y)),

then u satisfies the initial condition since

u(x, y)|t=0 = z(s, 0) = z0(s).
The following calculation shows that u is also a solution of the differential equation ( ).

a1ux + a2uy = a1(zssx + zttx) + a2(zssy + ztty) = zs(a1sx + a2sy) + zt(a1tx + a2ty) = zs(sxxt + syyt) + zt(txxt + tyyt) = a3

2.2. QUASILINEAR EQUATIONS

35

since 0 = st = sxxt + syyt and 1 = tt = txxt + tyyt.
(ii) Uniqueness. Suppose that v(x, y) is a second solution. Consider a point (x , y ) in a neighbourhood of the curve (x0(s), y(s)), s1 -  s  s2 + ,
> 0 small. The inverse parameters are s = s(x , y ), t = t(x , y ), see Figure 2.5.

Let A : x(t) := x(s , t), y(t) := y(s , t), z(t) := z(s , t)
be the solution of the above initial value problem for the characteristic differential equations with the initial data
x(s , 0) = x0(s ), y(s , 0) = y0(s ), z(s , 0) = z0(s ). According to its construction this curve is on the surface S defined by u = u(x, y) and u(x , y ) = z(s , t ). Set
(t) := v(x(t), y(t)) - z(t),
then
 (t) = vxx + vyy - z = xxa1 + vya2 - a3 = 0
and (0) = v(x(s , 0), y(s , 0)) - z(s , 0) = 0
since v is a solution of the differential equation and satisfies the initial condition by assumption. Thus, (t)  0, i. e.,
v(x(s , t), y(s , t)) - z(s , t) = 0.

36

CHAPTER 2. EQUATIONS OF FIRST ORDER

Set t = t , then

v(x , y ) - z(s , t ) = 0,

which shows that v(x , y ) = u(x , y ) because of z(s , t ) = u(x , y ).

is given by

x = t + x0(s), y = t + y0(s), z = z0(s),

i. e.,

x = t + s, y = t + 1, z = z0(s).

It follows s = x - y + 1, t = y - 1 and that u = z0(x - y + 1) is the solution of the Cauchy initial value problem.

2. A problem from kinetics in chemistry. Consider for x  0, y  0 the problem
ux + uy = k0e-k1x + k2 (1 - u)
with initial data

u(x, 0) = 0, x > 0, and u(0, y) = u0(y), y > 0.
Here the constants kj are positive, these constants define the velocity of the reactions in consideration, and the function u0(y) is given. The variable x is the time and y is the hight of a tube, for example, in which the chemical reaction takes place, and u is the concentration of the chemical substance.
In contrast to our previous assumptions, the initial data are not in C1. The projection C1  C2 of the initial curve onto the (x, y)-plane has a corner at the origin, see Figure 2.7.

CHAPTER 2. EQUATIONS OF FIRST ORDER

The associated system of characteristic equations is

x (t) = 1, y (t) = 1, z (t) = k0e-k1x + k2 (1 - z).

It follows x = t + c1, y = t + c2 with constants cj. Thus the projection of the characteristic curves on the (x, y)-plane are straight lines parallel to
y = x. We will solve the initial value problems in the domains 1 and 2, see Figure 2.7, separately.

(i)The initial value problem in 1. The initial data are

x0(s) = s, y0(s) = 0, z0(0) = 0, s  0.

It follows

x = x(s, t) = t + s, y = y(s, t) = t.

Thus

z (t) = (k0e-k1(t+s) + k2)(1 - z), z(0) = 0.

z (t) = (k0e-k1t + k2)(1 - z), z(0) = 0.

If u0(0) > 0, then u1 < u2 if x = y, i. e., there is a jump of the concentration of the substrate along its burning front defined by x = y.

Remark. Such a problem with discontinuous initial data is called Riemann problem. See an exercise for another Riemann problem.

The case that a solution of the equation is known
Here we will see that we get immediately a solution of the Cauchy initial value problem if a solution of the homogeneous linear equation

a1(x, y)ux + a2(x, y)uy = 0

is known. Let

x0(s), y0(s), z0(s), s1 < s < s2

be the initial data and let u = (x, y) be a solution of the differential equation. We assume that

x(x0(s), y0(s))x0(s) + y(x0(s), y0(s))y0(s) = 0
is satisfied. Set g(s) = (x0(s), y0(s)) and let s = h(g) be the inverse function.

The solution of the Cauchy initial problem is given by u0 (h((x, y))).

40

CHAPTER 2. EQUATIONS OF FIRST ORDER

This follows since in the problem considered a composition of a solution is a solution again, see an exercise, and since
u0 (h((x0(s), y0(s))) = u0(h(g)) = u0(s).

Example: Consider equation ux + uy = 0
with initial data x0(s) = s, y0(s) = 1, u0(s) is a given function.
A solution of the differential equation is (x, y) = x - y. Thus ((x0(s), y0(s)) = s - 1
and u0( + 1) = u0(x - y + 1)
is the solution of the problem.

2.3 Nonlinear equations in two variables

Here we consider equation

F (x, y, z, p, q) = 0,

(2.6)

where z = u(x, y), p = ux(x, y), q = uy(x, y) and F  C2 is given such that Fp2 + Fq2 = 0.
In contrast to the quasilinear case, this general nonlinear equation is more complicated. Together with (2.6) we will consider the following system of ordinary equations which follow from considerations below as necessary conditions, in particular from the assumption that there is a solution of (2.6).

x (t) = Fp y (t) = Fq z (t) = pFp + qFq p (t) = -Fx - Fup q (t) = -Fy - Fuq.

Definition. Equations (2.7)­(2.11) are said to be characteristic equations of equation (2.6) and a solution
(x(t), y(t), z(t), p(t), q(t))
of the characteristic equations is called characteristic strip or Monge curve.

Figure 2.8: Gaspard Monge (Panth´eon, Paris)

We will see, as in the quasilinear case, that the strips defined by the characteristic equations build the solution surface of the Cauchy initial value problem.
Let z = u(x, y) be a solution of the general nonlinear differential equation (2.6).
Let (x0, y0, z0) be fixed, then equation (2.6) defines a set of planes given by (x0, y0, z0, p, q), i. e., planes given by z = v(x, y) which contain the point (x0, y0, z0) and for which vx = p, vy = q at (x0, y0). In the case of quasilinear equations these set of planes is a bundle of planes which all contain a fixed straight line, see Section 2.1. In the general case of this section the situation is more complicated.

Consider the example p2 + q2 = f (x, y, z),

(2.12)

42

CHAPTER 2. EQUATIONS OF FIRST ORDER

where f is a given positive function. Let E be a plane defined by z = v(x, y)

and which contains (x0, y0, z0). Then the normal on the plane E directed

downward is

N=

1

(p, q, -1),

1 + |v|2

where p = vx(x0, y0), q = vy(x0, y0). It follows from (2.12) that the normal N makes a constant angle with the z-axis, and the z-coordinate of N is constant, see Figure 2.9.

Figure 2.9: Monge cone in an example
Thus the endpoints of the normals fixed at (x0, y0, z0) define a circle parallel to the (x, y)-plane, i. e., there is a cone which is the envelope of all these planes.
We assume that the general equation (2.6) defines such a Monge cone at each point in R3. Then we seek a surface S which touches at each point its Monge cone, see Figure 2.10.
More precisely, we assume there exists, as in the above example, a one parameter C1-family
p() = p(; x, y, z), q() = q(; x, y, z)
of solutions of (2.6). These (p(), q()) define a family () of planes.

Let x( ) = (x( ), y( ), z( ))
be a curve on the surface S which touches at each point its Monge cone, see Figure 2.11. Thus we assume that at each point of the surface S the associated tangent plane coincides with a plane from the family () at this point. Consider the tangential plane Tx0 of the surface S at x0 = (x(0), y(0), z(0)). The straight line

l() = x0 + x (0), - <  < ,

is an apothem (in German: Mantellinie) of the cone by assumption and is

contained in the tangential plane Tx0 as the tangent of a curve on the surface S. It is defined through

x (0) = l ().

(2.13)

The straight line l() satisfies

l3() - z0 = (l1() - x0)p(0) + (l2() - y0)q(0),

since it is contained in the tangential plane Tx0 defined by the slope (p, q). It follows
l3() = p(0)l1() + q(0)l2().

Together with (2.13) we obtain

z ( ) = p(0)x ( ) + q(0)y ( ).

(2.14)

The above straight line l is the limit of the intersection line of two neighbouring planes which envelopes the Monge cone:

z - z0 = (x - x0)p(0) + (y - y0)q(0) z - z0 = (x - x0)p(0 + h) + (y - y0)q(0 + h).

On the intersection one has

(x - x0)p() + (y - y0)q(0) = (x - x0)p(0 + h) + (y - y0)q(0 + h). Let h  0, it follows

(x - x0)p (0) + (y - y0)q (0) = 0.

Since x = l1(), y = l2() in this limit position, we have

p (0)l1() + q (0)l2() = 0, and it follows from (2.13) that

p (0)x ( ) + q (0)y ( ) = 0.

(2.15)

From the differential equation F (x0, y0, z0, p(), q()) = 0 we see that

Fpp () + Fqq () = 0.

we get equations (2.10) and (2.11). Assume the surface z = u(x, y) under consideration is in C2, then

Fx + Fzp + Fppx + Fqpy = 0, (qx = py) Fx + Fzp + x (t)px + y (t)py = 0
Fx + Fzp + p (t) = 0

46

CHAPTER 2. EQUATIONS OF FIRST ORDER

since p = p(x, y) = p(x(t), y(t)) on the curve x(t). Thus equation (2.10) of the characteristic system is shown. Differentiating the differential equation (2.6) with respect to y, we get finally equation (2.11).

Remark. In the previous quasilinear case
F (x, y, z, p, q) = a1(x, y, z)p + a2(x, y, z)q - a3(x, y, z)
the first three characteristic equations are the same:
x (t) = a1(x, y, z), y (t) = a2(x, y, z), z (t) = a3(x, y, z).
The point is that the right hand sides are independent on p or q. It follows from Theorem 2.1 that there exists a solution of the Cauchy initial value problem provided the initial data are noncharacteristic. That is, we do not need the other remaining two characteristic equations.
The other two equations (2.10) and (2.11) are satisfied in this quasilinear case automatically if there is a solution of the equation, see the above derivation of these equations.

The geometric meaning of the first three characteristic differential equations (2.7)­(2.11) is the following one. Each point of the curve A : (x(t), y(t), z(t)) corresponds a tangential plane with the normal direction (-p, -q, 1) such that

z (t) = p(t)x (t) + q(t)y (t).
This equation is called strip condition. On the other hand, let z = u(x, y) defines a surface, then z(t) := u(x(t), y(t)) satisfies the strip condition, where p = ux and q = uy, that is, the "scales" defined by the normals fit together.
Proposition 2.3. F (x, y, z, p, q) is an integral, i. e., it is constant along each characteristic curve.

Corollary. Assume F (x0, y0, z0, p0, q0) = 0, then F = 0 along characteristic curves with the initial data (x0, y0, z0, p0, q0).
Proposition 2.4. Let z = u(x, y), u  C2, be a solution of the nonlinear equation (2.6). Set
z0 = u(x0, y0, ) p0 = ux(x0, y0), q0 = uy(x0, y0). Then the associated characteristic strip is in the surface S, defined by z = u(x, y). Thus
z(t) = u(x(t), y(t)) p(t) = ux(x(t), y(t)) q(t) = uy(x(t), y(t)), where (x(t), y(t), z(t), p(t), q(t)) is the solution of the characteristic system (2.7)­(2.11) with initial data (x0, y0, z0, p0, q0)
Proof. Consider the initial value problem
x (t) = Fp(x, y, u(x, y), ux(x, y), uy(x, y)) y (t) = Fq(x, y, u(x, y), ux(x, y), uy(x, y)) with the initial data x(0) = x0, y(0) = y0. We will show that (x(t), y(t), u(x(t), y(t)), ux(x(t), y(t)), uy(x(t), y(t))) is a solution of the characteristic system. We recall that the solution exists and is uniquely determined. Set z(t) = u(x(t), y(t)), then (x(t), y(t), z(t))  S, and
z (t) = uxx (t) + uyy (t) = uxFp + uyFq. Set p(t) = ux(x(t), y(t)), q(t) = uy(x(t), y(t)), then
p (t) = uxxFp + uxyFq q (t) = uyxFp + uyyFq. Finally, from the differential equation F (x, y, u(x, y), ux(x, y), uy(x, y)) = 0 it follows
p (t) = -Fx - Fup q (t) = -Fy - Fuq.

2.3.1 Initial value problem of Cauchy

Let

x = x0(s), y = y0(s), z = z0(s), p = p0(s), q = q0(s), s1 < s < s2, (2.17)

be a given initial strip such that the strip condition

z0(s) = p0(s)x0(s) + q0(s)y0(s)

(2.18)

is satisfied. Moreover, we assume that the initial strip satisfies the nonlinear equation, that is,

F (x0(s), y0(s), z0(s), p0(s), q0(s)) = 0.

(2.19)

Initial value problem of Cauchy: Find a C2-solution z = u(x, y) of F (x, y, z, p, q) = 0 such that the surface S defined by z = u(x, y) contains the above initial strip.
Similar to the quasilinear case we will show that the set of strips defined by the characteristic system which are sticked at the initial strip, see Figure 2.12, fit together and define the surface for which we are looking at.
Definition. A strip (x( ), y( ), z( ), p( ), q( )), 1 <  < 2, is said to be noncharacteristic if
x ( )Fq(x( ), y( ), z( ), p( ), q( ))-y ( )Fp(x( ), y( ), z( ), p( ), q( )) = 0.

Theorem 2.2. For a given noncharacteristic initial strip (2.17), x0, y0, z0  C2 and p0, q0  C1 which satisfies the strip condition (2.18) and the differential equation (2.19) there exists exactly one solution z = u(x, y) of the Cauchy initial value problem in a neighbourhood of the initial curve (x0(s), y0(s), z0(s)), i. e., z = u(x, y) is the solution of the differential equation (2.6) and u(x0(s), y0(s)) = z0(s), ux(x0(s), y0(s)) = p0(s), uy(x0(s), y0(s)) = q0(s).
Proof. Consider the system (2.7)­(2.11) with initial data
x(s, 0) = x0(s), y(s, 0) = y0(s), z(s, 0) = z0(s), p(s, 0) = p0(s), q(s, 0) = q0(s).
We will show that the surface defined by x = x(s, t), y(s, t) is the surface defined by z = u(x, y), where u is the solution of the Cauchy initial value

problem. It turns out that u(x, y) = z(s(x, y), t(x, y)), where s = s(x, y), t = t(x, y) is the inverse of x = x(s, t), y = y(s, t) in a neigbourhood of t = 0. This inverse exists since the initial strip is noncharacteristic by assumption:

Set P (x, y) = p(s(x, y), t(x, y)), Q(x, y) = q(s(x, y), t(x, y)).

From Proposition 2.3 and Proposition 2.4 it follows F (x, y, u, P, Q) = 0. We will show that P (x, y) = ux(x, y) and Q(x, y) = uy(x, y). To see this, we consider the function
h(s, t) = zs - pxs - qys.

One has

h(s, 0) = z0(s) - p0(s)x0(s) - q0(s)y0(s) = 0

since the initial strip satisfies the strip condition by assumption. In the following we will find that for fixed s the function h satisfies a linear homogeneous ordininary differential equation of first order. Consequently,

50

CHAPTER 2. EQUATIONS OF FIRST ORDER

h(s, t) = 0 in a neighbourhood of t = 0. Thus the strip condition is also satisfied along strips transversally to the characteristic strips, see Figure 2.18. Thaen the set of "scales" fit together and define a surface like the scales of a fish.
From the definition of h(s, t) and the characteristic equations we get

ht(s, t) = zst - ptxs - qtys - pxst - qyst

= (pxs + qys)Fz + Fxxs + Fyzs + Fpps + Fqqs.

Since F (x(s, t), y(s, t), z(s, t), p(s, t), q(s, t)) = 0, it follows after differentiation of this equation with respect to s the differential equation

ht = -Fzh.

Hence h(s, t)  0, since h(s, 0) = 0.

Thus we have
zs = pxs + qys zt = pxt + qyt zs = uxxs + uyys zt = uxyt + uyyt.
The first equation was shown above, the second is a characteristic equation and the last two follow from z(s, t) = u(x(s, t), y(s, t)). This system implies
(P - ux)xs + (Q - uy)ys = 0 (P - ux)xt + (Q - uy)yt = 0.
It follows P = ux and Q = uy. The initial conditions
u(x(s, 0), y(s, 0)) = z0(s) ux(x(s, 0), y(s, 0)) = p0(s) uy(x(s, 0), y(s, 0)) = q0(s)
are satisfied since
u(x(s, t), y(s, t)) = z(s(x, y), t(x, y)) = z(s, t) ux(x(s, t), y(s, t)) = p(s(x, y), t(x, y)) = p(s, t) uy(x(s, t), y(s, t)) = q(s(x, y), t(x, y)) = q(s, t).

The uniqueness follows as in the proof of Theorem 2.1.

Example. A differential equation which occurs in the geometrical optic is
u2x + u2y = f (x, y),
where the positive function f (x, y) is the index of refraction. The level sets defined by u(x, y) = const. are called wave fronts. The characteristic curves (x(t), y(t)) are the rays of light. If n is a constant, then the rays of light are straight lines. In R3 the equation is
u2x + u2y + u2z = f (x, y, z).
Thus we have to extend the previous theory from R2 to Rn, n  3.

2.4 Nonlinear equations in Rn

Here we consider the nonlinear differential equation

F (x, z, p) = 0,

(2.20)

where

x = (x1, . . . , xn), z = u(x) :   Rn  R, p = u.

The following system of 2n + 1 ordinary differential equations is called characteristic system.

x (t) = pF z (t) = p · pF p (t) = -xF - Fzp.

Let x0(s) = (x01(s), . . . , x0n(s)), s = (s1, . . . , sn-1),
be a given regular (n-1)-dimensional C2-hypersurface in Rn, i. e., we assume

rank

x0(s) s

=

Here s  D is a parameter from an (n - 1)-dimensional parameter domain D.
For example, x = x0(s) defines in the three dimensional case a regular surface in R3.

z0(s) : D  R, p0(s) = (p01(s), . . . , p0n(s))

Initial value problem of Cauchy. Seek a solution z = u(x) of the differential equation (2.20) such that the initial manifold is a subset of {(x, u(x), u(x)) : x  }.

As in the two dimensional case we have under additional regularity assumptions

Theorem 2.3. Suppose the initial strip manifold is not characteristic and
satisfies differential equation (2.20), that is, F (x0(s), z0(s), p0(s)) = 0. Then there is a neighbourhood of the initial manifold (x0(s), z0(s)) such that there exists a unique solution of the Cauchy initial value problem.

Sketch of proof. Let

x = x(s, t), z = z(s, t), p = p(s, t)

be the solution of the characteristic system and let

s = s(x), t = t(x)

2.5. HAMILTON-JACOBI THEORY

be the inverse of x = x(s, t) which exists in a neighbourhood of t = 0. Then, it turns out that
z = u(x) := z(s1(x1, . . . , xn), . . . , sn-1(x1, . . . , xn), t(x1, . . . , xn))
is the solution of the problem.

2.5 Hamilton-Jacobi theory

The nonlinear equation (2.20) of previous section in one more dimension is

F (x1, . . . , xn, xn+1, z, p1, . . . , pn, pn+1) = 0.

The content of the Hamilton1-Jacobi2 theory is the theory of the special

case

F  pn+1 + H(x1, . . . , xn, xn+1, p1, . . . , pn) = 0,

(2.21)

i. e., the equation is linear in pn+1 and does not depend on z explicitly.

Remark. Formally, one can write equation (2.20)

F (x1, . . . , xn, u, ux1, . . . , uxn) = 0

as an equation of type (2.21). Set xn+1 = u and seek u implicitely from

(x1, . . . , xn, xn+1) = const.,

where  is a function which is defined by a differential equation. Assume xn+1 = 0, then

Here is

x = (x1, . . . , xn), p = (p1, . . . , pn).

Let x(t), p(t) be a solution of (2.23) and (2.24), then it follows pn+1(t) and z (t) from the characteristic equations

pn+1(t) = -Ht z (t) = p · pH - H.

Definition. The function H(x, t, p) is called Hamilton function, equation (2.21) Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the system (2.23), (2.24) canonical system to H.
There is an interesting interplay between the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the canonical system. According to the previous theory we can construct a solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation by using solutions of the

2.5. HAMILTON-JACOBI THEORY

55

canonical system. On the other hand, one obtains from solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation also solutions of the canonical system of ordinary differential equations.
Definition. A solution (a; x, t) of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, where a = (a1, . . . , an) is an n-tuple of real parameters, is called a complete integral of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation if
det(xial )ni,l=1 = 0.

Remark. If u is a solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, then also u + const.

Theorem 2.4 (Jacobi). Assume u = (a; x, t) + c, c = const.,   C2 in its arguments,
is a complete integral. Then one obtains by solving of
bi = ai(a; x, t)
with respect to xl = xl(a, b, t), where bi i = 1, . . . , n are given real constants, and then by setting
pk = xk (a; x(a, b; t), t) a 2n-parameter family of solutions of the canonical system.

Proof. Let

xl(a, b; t), l = 1, . . . , n,

be the solution of the above system. The solution exists since  is a complete integral by assumption. Set

pk(a, b; t) = xk (a; x(a, b; t), t), k = 1, . . . , n.

We will show that x and p solves the canonical system. Differentiating ai = bi with respect to t and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation t + H(x, t, x) = 0
with respect to ai, we obtain for i = 1, . . . , n

The motion of a mass point in a central field takes place in a plane, say the (x, y)-plane, see Figure 2.13, and satisfies the system of ordinary differential equations of second order

x (t) = Ux, y (t) = Uy,

where

U (x, y) = k2 . x2 + y2

Here we assume that k2 is a positive constant and that the mass point is attracted of the origin. In the case that it is pushed one has to replace U by -U . See Landau and Lifschitz [12], Vol 1, for example, for the related physics.

Chapter 3
Classification
Different types of problems in physics, for example, correspond different types of partial differential equations. The methods how to solve these equations differ from type to type.
The classification of differential equations follows from one single question: Can we calculate formally the solution if sufficiently many initial data are given? Consider the initial problem for an ordinary differential equation y (x) = f (x, y(x)), y(x0) = y0. Then one can determine formally the solution, provided the function f (x, y) is sufficiently regular. The solution of the initial value problem is formally given by a power series. This formal solution is a solution of the problem if f (x, y) is real analytic according to a theorem of Cauchy. In the case of partial differential equations the related theorem is the Theorem of Cauchy-Kowalevskaya. Even in the case of ordinary differential equations the situation is more complicated if y is implicitly defined, i. e., the differential equation is F (x, y(x), y (x)) = 0 for a given function F .
3.1 Linear equations of second order
The general nonlinear partial differential equation of second order is
F (x, u, Du, D2u) = 0,
where x  Rn, u :   Rn  R, Du  u and D2u stands for all second derivatives. The function F is given and sufficiently regular with respect to its 2n + 1 + n2 arguments.

Concerning the classification the main part

Consider a hypersurface S in Rn defined implicitly by (x) = 0,  = 0,

see Figure 3.1

Assume u and u are given on S.

Problem: Can we calculate all other derivatives of u on S by using differential equation (3.1) and the given data?

We will find an answer if we map S onto a hyperplane S0 by a mapping

n = (x1, . . . , xn) i = i(x1, . . . , xn), i = 1, . . . , n - 1,

for functions i such that

det

in   Rn. It is assumed that  and i are sufficiently regular. Such a mapping  = (x) exists, see an exercise.

The above transform maps S onto a subset of the hyperplane defined by n = 0, see Figure 3.2.
We will write the differential equation in these new coordinates. Here we use Einstein's convention, i. e., we add terms with repeating indices. Since

u(x) = u(x()) =: v() = v((x)),

where x = (x1, . . . , xn) and  = (1, . . . , n), we get

Since vk (1, . . . , n-1, 0), k = 1, . . . , n, are known, see (3.2), it follows that vkl, l = 1, . . . , n-1, are known on S0. Thus we know all second derivatives vij on S0 with the only exception of vnn.

Definition. The differential equation
n
aij (x)xi xj = 0
i,j=1
is called characteristic differential equation associated to the given differential equation (3.1).
If ,  = 0, is a solution of the characteristic differential equation, then the surface defined by  = 0 is called characteristic surface.

Remark. The condition (3.3) is satisfied for each  with  = 0 if the quadratic matrix (aij(x)) is positive or negative definite for each x  , which is equivalent to the property that all eigenvalues are different from zero and have the same sign. This follows since there is a (x) > 0 such that, in the case that the matrix (aij) is poitive definite,
n
aij(x)ij  (x)||2
i,j=1
for all   Rn. Here and in the following we assume that the matrix (aij) is real and symmetric.
The characterization of differential equation (3.1) follows from the signs of the eigenvalues of (aij(x)).
Definition. Differential equation (3.1) is said to be of type (, , ) at x   if  eigenvalues of (aij)(x) are positive,  eigenvalues are negative and  eigenvalues are zero ( +  +  = n). In particular, equation is called elliptic if it is of type (n, 0, 0) or of type (0, n, 0), i. e., all eigenvalues are different from zero and have the same sign, parabolic if it is of type (n-1, 0, 1) or of type (0, n-1, 1), i. e., one eigenvalue is zero and all the others are different from zero and have the same sign, hyperbolic if it is of type (n - 1, 1, 0) or of type (1, n - 1, 0), i. e., all eigenvalues are different from zero and one eigenvalue has another sign than all the others.

68

CHAPTER 3. CLASSIFICATION

Remarks:
1. According to this definition there are other types aside from elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic equations.
2. The classification depends in general on x  . An example is the Tricomi equation, which appears in the theory of transsonic flows,
yuxx + uyy = 0.
This equation is elliptic if y > 0, parabolic if y = 0 and hyperbolic for y < 0.

Examples:

1. The Laplace equation in R3 is u = 0, where

u := uxx + uyy + uzz.

This equation is elliptic. Thus for each manifold S given by {(x, y, z) : (x, y, z) = 0}, where  is an arbitrary sufficiently regular function such that  = 0, all derivatives of u are known on S, provided u and u are known on S.

2. The wave equation utt = uxx + uyy + uzz, where u = u(x, y, z, t), is hyperbolic. Such a type describes oscillations of mechanical structures, for example.

3. The heat equation ut = uxx+uyy+uzz, where u = u(x, y, z, t), is parabolic. It describes, for example, the propagation of heat in a domain.

4. Consider the case that the (real) coefficients aij in equation (3.1) are constant. We recall that the matrix A = (aij) is symmetric, i. e., AT = A. In this case, the transform to principle axis leads to a normal form from which the classification of the equation is obviously. Let U be the associated orthogonal matrix, then

3.1.1 Normal form in two variables

Consider the differential equation

a(x, y)uxx + 2b(x, y)uxy + c(x, y)uyy + terms of lower order = 0 (3.5)

in   R2. The associated characteristic differential equation is

a2x + 2bxy + c2y = 0.

(3.6)

We show that an appropriate coordinate transform will simplify equation (3.5) sometimes in such a way that we can solve the transformed equation explicitly.
Let z = (x, y) be a solution of (3.6). Consider the level sets {(x, y) : (x, y) = const.} and assume y = 0 at a point (x0, y0) of the level set. Then there is a function y(x) defined in a neighbourhood of x0 such that (x, y(x)) = const. It follows

y

which implies, see the characteristic equation (3.6),

ay 2 - 2by + c = 0.

Then, provided a = 0, we can calculate µ := y from the (known) coefficients

a, b and c:

µ1,2

(3.8)

These solutions are real if and only of ac - b2  0.

Equation (3.5) is hyperbolic if ac - b2 < 0, parabolic if ac - b2 = 0 and

elliptic if ac - b2 > 0. This follows from an easy discussion of the eigenvalues

of the matrix

see an exercise.

Proposition 3.1. The mapping  = (x, y),  = (x, y) transforms equa-

tion (3.5) into

v = lower order terms,

(3.11)

where v(, ) = u(x(, ), y(, )).

Proof. The proof follows from a straightforward calculation.

ux = vx + vx
uy = vy + vy uxx = v2x + 2vxx + vx2 + lower order terms uxy = vxy + v(xy + yx) + vxy + lower order terms uyy = v2y + 2vyy + vy2 + lower order terms.

Thus where

auxx + 2buxy + cuyy = v + 2v + v + l.o.t.,

 : = a2x + 2bxy + c2y  : = axx + b(xy + yx) + cyy  : = ax2 + 2bxy + cy2.

The coefficients  and  are zero since  and  are solutions of the characteristic equation. Since

 - 2 = (ac - b2)(xy - yx)2,

it follows from the above lemma that the coefficient  is different from zero. 2

Example: Consider the differential equation uxx - uyy = 0.

72

CHAPTER 3. CLASSIFICATION

The associated characteristic differential equation is
2x - 2y = 0.
Since µ1 = -1 and µ2 = 1, the functions  and  satisfy differential equations

x + y = 0 x - y = 0.
Solutions with  = 0 and  = 0 are

 = x - y,  = x + y.

Thus the mapping

 = x - y,  = x + y

leads to the simple equation

v(, ) = 0.
Assume v  C2 is a solution, then v = f1() for an arbitrary C1 function f1(). It follows

v(, ) = f1() d + g(),
0
where g is an arbitrary C2 function. Thus each C2-solution of the differential equation can be written as

()

v(, ) = f () + g(),

where f, g  C2. On the other hand, for arbitrary C2-functions f , g the function ( ) is a solution of the differential equation v = 0. Consequently each C2-solution of the original equation uxx - uyy = 0 is given by

u(x, y) = f (x - y) + g(x + y),

where f, g  C2.

3.2 Quasilinear equations of second order

Here we consider the equation

n
aij(x, u, u)uxixj + b(x, u, u) = 0
i,j=1

(3.12)

in a domain   Rn, where u :   R. We assume that aij = aji. As in the previous section we can derive the characteristic equation

n
aij(x, u, u)xi xj = 0.
i,j=1

In contrast to linear equations, solutions of the characteristic equation depend on the solution considered.

3.2.1 Quasilinear elliptic equations
There is a large class of quasilinear equations such that the associated characteristic equation has no solution ,  = 0.
Set U = {(x, z, p) : x  , z  R, p  Rn}.

Definition. The quasilinear equation (3.12) is called elliptic if the matrix (aij(x, z, p)) is positive definite for each (x, z, p)  U .

Assume equation (3.12) is elliptic and let (x, z, p) be the minimum and (x, z, p) the maximum of the eigenvalues of (aij), then
n
0 < (x, z, p)||2  aij(x, z, p)ij  (x, z, p)||2

Definition. Equation (3.12) is called uniformly elliptic if / is uniformly bounded in U .

An important class of elliptic equations which are not uniformly elliptic (nonuniformly elliptic) is

Thus equation (3.13) is not uniformly elliptic. The behaviour of solutions of uniformly elliptic equations is similar to
linear elliptic equations in contrast to the behaviour of solutions of nonuniformly elliptic equations. Typical examples for nonuniformly elliptic equations are the minimal surface equation and the capillary equation.

3.3 Systems of first order

Consider the quasilinear system

We ask the same question as above: can we calculate all derivatives of u in a neighbourhood of a given hypersurface S in Rn defined by (x) = 0,  = 0, provided u(x) is given on S?
For an answer we map S onto a flat surface S0 by using the mapping  = (x) of Section 3.1 and write equation (3.14) in new coordinates. Set
v() = u(x()), then

n
Ak(x, u)xk vn = terms known on S0.

Definition. (i) The system (3.14) is hyperbolic at (x, u(x)) if there is a regular linear mapping  = Q, where  = (1, . . . , n-1, ), such that there exists m real roots k = k(x, u(x), 1, . . . , n-1), k = 1, . . . , m, of
D(x, u(x), 1, . . . , n-1, ) = 0
for all (1, . . . , n-1), where
D(x, u(x), 1, . . . , n-1, ) = C(x, u(x), x, Q).

(ii) System (3.14) is parabolic if there exists a regular linear mapping  = Q such that D is independent of , i. e., D depends on less than n parameters.
(iii) System (3.14) is elliptic if C(x, u, ) = 0 only if  = 0.
Remark. In the elliptic case all derivatives of the solution can be calculated from the given data and the given equation.

The Beltrami system is a generalization of Cauchy-Riemann equations.

The function f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y), where z = x + iy, is called a qua-

CHAPTER 3. CLASSIFICATION

It follows immediately that Maxwell equations are a hyperbolic system, see an exercise. There are two solutions of this characteristic equation. The first one are characteristic surfaces S(t), defined by (x, t) = 0, which satisfy t = 0. These surfaces are called stationary waves. The second type of characteristic surfaces are defined by solutions of

µ c2

2t

|x|2.

Functions defined by  = f (n · x - V t) are f (s) an arbitrary function with f (s) = 0,

solutions of this equation. n is a unit vector and V =

cH/ere

is µ.

The associated characteristic surfaces S(t) are defined by

(x, t)  f (n · x - V t) = 0,

here we assume that 0 is in he range of f : R  R. Thus, S(t) is defined by n · x - V t = c, where c is a fixed constant. It follows that the planes S(t) with normal n move with speed V in direction of n, see Figure 3.4

A special case of Maxwell equations are the telegraph equations, which follow from Maxwell equations if div E = 0 and div H = 0, i. e., E and

Here we consider the system

n
Akl(x, u, u)uxkxl + lower order terms = 0,
k,l=1

(3.24)

where Akl are (m × m) matrices and u = (u1, . . . , um)T . We assume Akl = Alk, which is no restriction of generality provided u  C2 is satisfied. As in the previous sections, the classification follows from the question whether or not we can calculate formally the solution from the differential equations, if sufficiently many data are given on an initial manifold. Let the initial manifold S be given by (x) = 0 and assume that  = 0. The mapping x = x(), see previous sections, leads to

n
Aklxk xl vnn = terms known on S,
k,l=1

where v() = u(x()).

The characteristic equation is here





n

det 

Aklxk xl  = 0.

k,l=1

If there is a solution  with  = 0, then it is possible that second derivatives are not continuous in a neighbourhood of S.

Definition. The system is called elliptic if

k,l=1

for all   Rn,  = 0.

where  is the (constant and positive) density of liquid,  is the (constant and positive) viscosity of liquid, v = v(x, t) velocity vector of liquid particles, x  R3 or in R2, p = p(x, t) pressure.
The problem is to find solutions v, p of the above system.

2. Linear elasticity

Consider the system

xu + ( + µ)x(divx u) + f.

Here is, in the case of an elastic body in R3, u(x, t) = (u1(x, t), u2(x, t), u3(x, t)) displacement vector, f (x, t) density of external force,  (constant) density, , µ (positive) Lam´e constants.

(3.25)

The characteristic equation is det C = 0, where the entries of the matrix C are given by
cij = ( + µ)xi xj + ij µ|x|2 - 2t .
The characteristic equation is ( + 2µ)|x|2 - 2t µ|x|2 - 2t 2 = 0.
It follows that two different speeds P of characteristic surfaces S(t), defined by (x, t) = const., are possible, namely

CHAPTER 3. CLASSIFICATION

3.5 Theorem of Cauchy-Kovalevskaya

Consider the quasilinear system of first order (3.14) of Section 3.3. Assume an initial manifolds S is given by (x) = 0,  = 0, and suppose that  is not characteristic. Then, see Section 3.3, the system (3.14) can be written as

n-1

uxn =

ai(x, u)uxi + b(x, u)

i=1

u(x1, . . . , xn-1, 0) = f (x1, . . . , xn-1)

(3.26) (3.27)

Here is u = (u1, . . . , um)T , b = (b1, . . . , bn)T and ai are (m×m)-matrices. We assume ai, b and f are in C with respect to their arguments. From (3.26) and (3.27) it follows that we can calculate formally all derivatives Du in a
neigbourhood of the plane {x : xn = 0}, in particular in a neighbourhood of 0  Rn. Thus we have a formal power series of u(x) at x = 0:

u(x) 

1 !

Du(0)x.

For notations and definitions used here and in the following see the appendix to this section.

Then, as usually, two questions arise: (i) Does the power series converge in a neighbourhood of 0  Rn?

(ii) Is a convergent power series a solution of the initial value problem (3.26), (3.27)?

Remark. Quite different to this power series method is the method of

asymptotic expansions. Here one is interested in a good approximation of

an unknown solution of an equation by a finite sum

i. In general, the infinite sum

 i=0

i(x)

does

not

N i=0

i(x)

of

functions

converge, in contrast

to the power series method of this section. See [15] for some asymptotic

formulas in capillarity.

Theorem 3.1 (Cauchy-Kovalevskaya). There is a neighbourhood of 0  Rn such there is a real analytic solution of the initial value problem (3.26), (3.27). This solution is unique in the class of real analytic functions.

3.5. THEOREM OF CAUCHY-KOVALEVSKAYA

85

Proof. The proof is taken from F. John [10]. We introduce u - f as the new solution for which we are looking at and we add a new coordinate u to the solution vector by setting u (x) = xn. Then

uxn = 1, uxk = 0, k = 1, . . . , n - 1, u (x1, . . . , xn-1, 0) = 0

and the extended system (3.26), (3.27) is







u1,xn ...
um,xn

 = n-1
i=1

uxn

ai 0 00



 



u1,xi ...
um,xi

 + 

b1 ... bm

 ,

where the associated initial condition is u(x1, . . . , xn-1, 0) = 0. The new u is u = (u1, . . . , um)T , the new ai are ai(x1, . . . , xn-1, u1, . . . , um, u ) and the new b is b = (x1, . . . , xn-1, u1, . . . , um, u )T .
Thus we are led to an initial value problem of the type

n-1 N

uj,xn =

aijk(z)uk,xi + bj(z), j = 1, . . . , N

i=1 k=1

uj(x) = 0 if xn = 0,

(3.28) (3.29)

where j = 1, . . . , N and z = (x1, . . . , xn-1, u1, . . . , uN ). The point here is that aijk and bj are independent of xn. This fact
simplifies the proof of the theorem. From (3.28) and (3.29) we can calculate formally all Duj. Then we
have formal power series for uj:

uj(x)  c(j)x,


where

c(j)

=

1 !

Duj

(0).

We will show that these power series are (absolutely) convergent in a neighbourhood of 0  Rn, i. e., they are real analytic functions, see the appendix

for the definition of real analytic functions. Inserting these functions into

the left and into the right hand side of (3.28) we obtain on the right and on

the left hand side real analytic functions. This follows since compositions

of real analytic functions are real analytic again, see Proposition A7 of the

appendix to this section. The resulting power series on the left and on the

86

CHAPTER 3. CLASSIFICATION

right have the same coefficients caused by the calculation of the derivatives Duj(0) from (3.28). It follows that uj(x), j = 1, . . . , n, defined by its
formal power series are solutions of the initial value problem (3.28), (3.29).

Lemma A. Assume u  C in a neighbourhood of 0  Rn. Then
Duj(0) = P daijk(0), dbj(0) ,
where ||, ||  || and P are polynomials in the indicated arguments with nonnegative integers as coefficients which are independent of ai and of b.

Proof. It follows from equation (3.28) that DnDuj(0) = P(daijk(0), dbj(0), Duk(0)).
Here is Dn = /xn and , , ,  satisfy the inequalities ||, ||  ||, ||  || + 1,

(3.30)

and, which is essential in the proof, the last coordinates in the multi-indices

 = (1, . . . , n),  = (1, . . . , n) satisfy n  n since the right hand side

of (3.28) is independent of xn. Moreover, it follows from (3.28) that the

polynomials P have integers as coefficients. The initial condition (3.29)

implies

Duj(0) = 0,

(3.31)

where  = (1, . . . , n-1, 0), that is, n = 0. Then, the proof is by induction with respect to n. The induction starts with n = 0, then we replace Duk(0) in the right hand side of (3.30) by (3.31), that is by zero. Then it follows from (3.30) that

Duj(0) = P(daijk(0), dbj(0), Duk(0)),

where  = (1, . . . , n-1, 1).

Uj(x1, . . . , xn-1, xn) = V (x1 + . . . + xn-1, xn), j = 1, . . . , N,

where V (s, t), s = x1 + . . . + xn-1, t = xn, is the solution of the Cauchy initial value problem

V (s, 0) = 0.

This function is real analytic in (s, t) at (0, 0). It follows that Uj(x) are also real analytic functions. Thus the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem is shown.

Examples:

1. Ordinary differential equations
Consider the initial value problem
y (x) = f (x, y(x)) y(x0) = y0,
where x0  R and y0  Rn are given. Assume f (x, y) is real analytic in a neighbourhood of (x0, y0)  R × Rn. Then it follows from the above theorem that there exists an analytic solution y(x) of the initial value problem in a neighbourhood of x0. This solution is unique in the class of analytic functions according to the theorem of Cauchy-Kovalevskaya. From the PicardLindel¨of theorem it follows that this analytic solution is unique even in the class of C1-functions.
2. Partial differential equations of second order
Consider the boundary value problem for two variables
uyy = f (x, y, u, ux, uy, uxx, uxy) u(x, 0) = (x) uy(x, 0) = (x).
We assume that ,  are analytic in a neighbourhood of x = 0 and that f is real analytic in a neighbourhood of
(0, 0, (0),  (0), (0),  (0)).
There exists a real analytic solution in a neigbourhood of 0  R2 of the above initial value problem.
In particular, there is a real analytic solution in a neigbourhood of 0  R2 of the initial value problem
u=1 u(x, 0) = 0 uy(x, 0) = 0.

90

CHAPTER 3. CLASSIFICATION

The proof follows by writing the above problem as a system. Set p = ux, q = uy, r = uxx, s = uxy, t = uyy, then

t = f (x, y, u, p, q, r, s).

Set U = (u, p, q, r, s, t)T , b = (q, 0, t, 0, 0, fy + fuq + fqt)T and

Then the rewritten differential equation is the system Uy = AUx + b with the initial condition

U (x, 0) = (x),  (x), (x),  (x),  (x), f0(x) ,

where f0(x) = f (x, 0, (x),  (x), (x),  (x),  (x)).

Q(z) : |xi|  |zi| for all i.

Thus the power series (3.34) defines a continuous function defined on Q(z), according to a theorem of Weierstrass.
The interior of Q(z) is not empty if and only if zi = 0 for all i, see Figure 3.7. For given x in a fixed compact subset D of Q(z) there is a q, 0 < q < 1, such that

CHAPTER 3. CLASSIFICATION

for all x  N (y), and the series converges (absolutely) for each x  N (y).
A function f is called real analytic in  if it is real analytic for each y  . We will write f  C() in the case that f is real analytic in the domain .
A vector valued function f (x) = (f1(x), . . . , fm) is called real analytic if each coordinate is real analytic.

Proposition A2. (i) Let f  C(). Then f  C().

(ii) Assume f  C(). Then for each y   there exists a neighbourhood N (y) and positive constants M , r such that

f (x) =



1 !

(Df

(y))(x

-

y)

for all x  N (y), and the series converges (absolutely) for each x  N (y),
and |Df (x)|  M ||!r-||.

The proof follows from Proposition A1.

An open set   Rn is called connected if  is not a union of two nonempty open sets with empty intersection. An open set   Rn is connected if and only if its path connected, see [11], pp. 38, for example. We say that  is path connected if for any x, y   there is a continuous curve (t)  , 0  t  1, with (0) = x and (1) = y. From the theory of one complex variable we know that a continuation of an analytic function is uniquely determined. The same is true for real analytic functions.

Proposition A3. Assume f  C() and  is connected. Then f is uniquely determined if for one z   all Df (z) are known.

Proof. See F. John [10], p. 65. Suppose g, h  C() and Dg(z) = Dh(z) for every . Set f = g - h and

1 = {x   : Df (x) = 0 for all }, 2 = {x   : Df (x) = 0 for at least one }.

The set 2 is open since Df are continuous in . The set 1 is also open since f (x) = 0 in a neighbourhood of y  1. This follows from

f (x) =



1 !

(Df

(y))(x

y)

.

Since z  1, i. e., 1 = , it follows 2 = .

It was shown in Proposition A2 that derivatives of a real analytic function
satisfy estimates. On the other hand it follows, see the next proposition, that a function f  C is real analytic if these estimates are satisfied.

Definition. Let y   and M, r positive constants. Then f is said to be in the class CM,r(y) if f  C in a neighbourhood of y and if
|Df (y)|  M ||!r-||

for all .

Proposition A4. f  C() if and only if f  C() and for every compact subset S   there are positive constants M, r such that

f  CM,r(y) for all y  S.

Proof. See F. John [10], pp. 65-66. We will prove the local version of the proposition, that is, we show it for each fixed y  . The general version follows from Heine-Borel theorem. Because of Proposition A3 it remains to show that the Taylor series

Define a neighbourhood of y by

Remark. The definition of f << F implies, trivially, that Df << DF .
The next proposition shows that compositions majorize if the involved functions majorize. More precisely, we have
Proposition A6. Let f, F : Rn  Rm and g, G maps a neighbourhood of 0  Rm into Rp. Assume all functions f (x), F (x), g(u), G(u) are in C, f (0) = F (0) = 0, f << F and g << G. Then g(f (x)) << G(F (x)).
Proof. See F. John [10], p. 68. Set
h(x) = g(f (x)), H(x) = G(F (x)).
For each coordinate hk of h we have, according to the chain rule, Dhk(0) = P(gl(0), Dfj(0)),
where P are polynomials with nonnegative integers as coefficients, P are independent on g or f and  := (/u1, . . . , /um). Thus,
|Dhk(0)|  P(|gl(0)|, |Dfj(0)|)  P(Gl(0), DFj(0)) = DHk(0).
2
Using this result and Proposition A4, which characterizes real analytic functions, it follows that compositions of real analytic functions are real analytic functions again.
Proposition A7. Assume f (x) and g(u) are real analytic, then g(f (x)) is real analytic if f (x) is in the domain of definition of g.
Proof. See F. John [10], p. 68. Assume that f maps a neighbourhood of y  Rn in Rm and g maps a neighbourhood of v = f (y) in Rm. Then f  CM,r(y) and g  Cµ,(v) implies
h(x) := g(f (x))  Cµ,r/(mM+)(y). Once one has shown this inclusion, the proposition follows from Proposition A4. To show the inclusion, we set
h(y + x) := g(f (y + x))  g(v + f (y + x) - f (x)) =: g(f (x)),

Hyperbolic equations

Here we consider hyperbolic equations of second order, mainly wave equations.

4.1 One-dimensional wave equation

The one-dimensional wave equation is given by

1 c2

utt

-

uxx

=

0,

(4.1)

where u = u(x, t) is a scalar function of two variables and c is a positive constant. According to previous considerations, all C2-solutions of the wave
equation are

u(x, t) = f (x + ct) + g(x - ct),

(4.2)

with arbitrary C2-functions f and g

The Cauchy initial value problem for the wave equation is to find a C2solution of

1 c2

uxx

u(x, 0) = (x)

ut(x, 0) = (x),

where ,   C2(-, ) are given.

108

CHAPTER 4. HYPERBOLIC EQUATIONS

Theorem 4.1. There exists a unique C2(R × R)-solution of the Cauchy initial value problem, and this solution is given by d'Alembert's1 formula

u(x, t)

=

(x

+

ct)

+ 2

(x - ct)

+

1 2c

x+ct
(s) ds.

(4.3)

Proof. Assume there is a solution u(x, t) of the Cauchy initial value problem, then it follows from (4.2) that

u(x, 0) = f (x) + g(x) = (x) ut(x, 0) = cf (x) - cg (x) = (x).

(4.4) (4.5)

From (4.4) we obtain

f (x) + g (x) =  (x),

which implies, together with (4.5), that

f (x)

=

 (x) + (x)/c 2

g (x)

=



(x)

The constants C1, C2 satisfy

C1 + C2 = f (x) + g(x) - (x) = 0,

see (4.4). Thus each C2-solution of the Cauchy initial value problem is given by d'Alembert's formula. On the other hand, the function u(x, t) defined by the right hand side of (4.3) is a solution of the initial value problem. 2

Corollaries. 1. The solution u(x, t) of the initial value problem depends on the values of  at the endpoints of the interval [x - ct, x + ct] and on the values of  on this interval only, see Figure 4.1. The interval [x - ct, x + ct] is called domain of dependence.

and consider the initial value problem

2u = 0 in Rn × R u(x, 0) = f (x) ut(x, 0) = g(x),

(4.6) (4.7) (4.8)

where f and g are given C2(R2)-functions. By using spherical means and the above d'Alembert formula we will
derive a formula for the solution of this initial value problem.

Method of spherical means

Define the spherical mean for a C2-solution u(x, t) of the initial value prob-

lem by

M (r, t)

=

1 nrn-1

u(y, t) dSy,
 Br (x)

(4.9)

where

n = (2)n/2/(n/2)

is the area of the n-dimensional sphere, nrn-1 is the area of a sphere with radius r.
From the mean value theorem of the integral calculus we obtain the function u(x, t) for which we are looking at by

u(x, t) = lim M (r, t).
r0

Using the initial data, we have

M (r, 0)

=

1 nrn-1

f (y) dSy =: F (r)
 Br (x)

Mt(r, 0)

=

1 nrn-1

g(y) dSy =: G(r),
 Br (x)

which are the spherical means of f and g.

(4.10)
(4.11) (4.12)

The next step is to derive a partial differential equation for the spherical mean. From definition (4.9) of the spherical mean we obtain, after the mapping  = (y - x)/r, where x and r are fixed,

M (r, t)

=

1 n

u(x + r, t) dS.
B1(0)

uyi(x + r, t)i dS
B1(0) i=1

n
uyi (y, t)i dSy.
Br(x) i=1

Integration by parts yields

1 nrn-1

n
uyiyi (y, t) dy
Br(x) i=1

since   (y - x)/r is the exterior normal at Br(x). Assume u is a solution of the wave equation, then

utt(y, t) dy
Br (x)

The previous equation follows by using spherical coordinates. Consequently

 Br (x)

Thus we arrive at the differential equation

(rn-1Mr)r = c-2rn-1Mtt,

which can be written as

c-2Mtt.

This equation (4.13) is called Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation.

(4.13)

112

CHAPTER 4. HYPERBOLIC EQUATIONS

4.2.1 Case n=3
The Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation in this case is (rM )rr = c-2(rM )tt.

Thus rM is the solution of the one-dimensional wave equation with initial data

(rM )(r, 0) = rF (r) (rM )t(r, 0) = rG(r).

(4.14)

From the d'Alembert formula we get formally

M (r, t)

=

(r + ct)F (r + ct) + (r - ct)F (r - ct) 2r

+

1 2cr

r+ct
G() d.
r-ct

(4.15)

The right hand side of the previous formula is well defined if the domain of dependence [x - ct, x + ct] is a subset of (0, ). We can extend F and G to F0 and G0 which are defined on (-, ) such that rF0 and rG0 are C2(R)-functions as follows. Set

  F (r) : r > 0

F0(r)

=



f (x) F (-r)

: :

r=0 r<0

The function G0(r) is given by the same definition where F and f are replaced by G and g, respectively.
Lemma. rF0(r), rG0(r)  C2(R2).
Proof. From definition of F (r) and G(r), r > 0, it follows from the mean value theorem

lim F (r) = f (x), lim G(r) = g(x).

r+0

r+0

Thus rF0(r) and rG0(r) are C(R)-functions. These functions are also in

C1(R). This follows since F0 and G0 are in C1(R). We have, for example,

F (r)

=

B1(0) j=1

F (+0)

n
fyj (x)j dS
B1(0) j=1

n j=1

fyj (x)

B1(0)

Then, rF0(r) and rG0(r) are in C2(R), provided F and G are bounded as r  +0. This property follows from

The solution of the above initial value problem, where F and G are replaced by F0 and G0, respectively, is

(r + ct)F0(r + ct) + (r - ct)F0(r - ct) 2r

see Figure 4.3. For fixed t > 0 and 0 < r < ct it follows that M0(r, t) is the solution of the initial value problem with given initially data (4.14) since F0(s) = F (s), G0(s) = G(s) if s > 0. Since for fixed t > 0

Theorem 4.2. Assume f  C3(R3) and g  C2(R3) are given. Then there exists a unique solution u  C2(R3 × [0, )) of the initial value prob-

(4.18) (4.19) (4.20)

where f  C3, g  C2. Using the formula for the solution of the three-dimensional initial value
problem we will derive a formula for the two-dimensional case. The following consideration is called Hadamard's method of decent.
Let v(x, y, t) be a solution of (4.18)-(4.20), then

u(x, y, z, t) := v(x, y, t)

116

CHAPTER 4. HYPERBOLIC EQUATIONS

is a solution of the three-dimensional initial value problem with initial data f (x, y), g(x, y), independent of z, since u satisfies (4.18)-(4.20). Hence, since u(x, y, z, t) = u(x, y, 0, t) + uz(x, y, z, t)z, 0 <  < 1, and uz = 0, we have
v(x, y, t) = u(x, y, 0, t).

The positive sign applies on S+, where  > 0 and the sign is negative on S- where  < 0, see Figure 4.5. We have S = S+  S-.
Set  = ( - x)2 + ( - y)2. Then it follows from (4.21)

Corollary. In contrast to the three dimensional case, the domain of dependence is here the disk Bcto(x0, y0) and not the boundary only. Therefore, see formula of Theorem 4.3, if f, g have supports in a compact domain D  R2, then these functions have influence on the value v(x, y, t) for all time t > T , T sufficiently large.

4.3 Inhomogeneous equation

Here we consider the initial value problem

2u = w(x, t) on x  Rn, t  R u(x, 0) = f (x) ut(x, 0) = g(x),

(4.22) (4.23) (4.24)

where 2u := utt - c2 u. We assume f  C3, g  C2 and w  C1, which are given.
Set u = u1 + u2, where u1 is a solution of problem (4.22)-(4.24) with w := 0 and u2 is the solution where f = 0 and g = 0 in (4.22)-(4.24). Since we have explicit solutions u1 in the cases n = 1, n = 2 and n = 3, it remains to solve

2u = w(x, t) on x  Rn, t  R u(x, 0) = 0 ut(x, 0) = 0.

(4.25) (4.26) (4.27)

The following method is called Duhamel's principle which can be considered as a generalization of the method of variations of constants in the theory of ordinary differential equations.

118

CHAPTER 4. HYPERBOLIC EQUATIONS

To solve this problem, we make the ansatz
t
u(x, t) = v(x, t, s) ds,
0
where v is a function satisfying

(4.28)

2v = 0 for all s

(4.29)

and

v(x, s, s) = 0.

(4.30)

From ansatz (4.28) and assumption (4.30) we get

t

ut = v(x, t, t) + vt(x, t, s) ds,

0

t

=

vt(x, t, s).

(4.31)

It follows ut(x, 0) = 0. The initial condition u(x, t) = 0 is satisfied because of the ansatz (4.28). From (4.31) and ansatz (4.28) we see that

t

utt = vt(x, t, t) + vtt(x, t, s) ds,

0

t

xu =

xv(x, t, s) ds.

Therefore, since u is an ansatz for (4.25)-(4.27),

t
utt - c2 xu = vt(x, t, t) + (2v)(x, t, s) ds
0
= w(x, t).

Thus necessarily vt(x, t, t) = w(x, t), see (4.29). We have seen that the ansatz provides a solution of (4.25)-(4.27) if for all s

2v = 0, v(x, s, s) = 0, vt(x, s, s) = w(x, s). Let v(x, t, s) be a solution of

(4.32)

2v = 0, v(x, 0, s) = 0, vt(x, 0, s) = w(x, s),

(4.33)

then v(x, t, s) := v(x, t - s, s)

4.3. INHOMOGENEOUS EQUATION

is a solution of (4.32). In the case n = 3, where v is given by, see Theorem

4.4 A method of Riemann

Riemann's method provides a formula for the solution of the following Cauchy initial value problem for a hyperbolic equation of second order in two variables. Let

S : x = x(t), y = y(t), t1  t  t2,
be a regular curve in R2, that is, we assume x, y  C1[t1, t2] and x 2+y 2 = 0. Set
Lu := uxy + a(x, y)ux + b(x, y)uy + c(x, y)u,
where a, b  C1 and c, f  C in a neighbourhood of S. Consider the initial value problem

Lu = f (x, y) u0(t) = u(x(t), y(t)) p0(t) = ux(x(t), y(t)) q0(t) = uy(x(t), y(t)),

(4.34) (4.35) (4.36) (4.37)

where f  C in a neighbourhood of S and u0, p0, q0  C1 are given.

We assume:

4.4. A METHOD OF RIEMANN

121

(i) u0(t) = p0(t)x (t) + q0(t)y (t) (strip condition),
(ii) S is not a characteristic curve. Moreover assume that the characteristic curves, which are lines here and are defined by x = const. and y = const., have at most one point of intersection with S, and such a point is not a touching point, i. e., tangents of the characteristic and S are different at this point.

We recall that the characteristic equation to (4.34) is xy = 0 which is satisfied if x(x, y) = 0 or y(x, y) = 0. One family of characteristics associated to these first partial differential of first order is defined by
x (t) = 1, y (t) = 0, see Chapter 2.

Assume u, v  C1 and that uxy, vxy exist and are continuous. Define the adjoint differential expression by

We have

M v = vxy - (av)x - (bv)y + cv.

2(vLu - uM v) = (uxv - vxu + 2buv)y + (uyv - vyu + 2auv)x. Set

(4.38)

P = -(uxv - xxu + 2buv) Q = uyv - vyu + 2auv.
From (4.38) it follows for a domain   R2

2 (vLu - uM v) dxdy =

=

(-Py + Qx) dxdy

P dx + Qdy,

(4.39)

where integration in the line integral is anticlockwise. The previous equation follows from Gauss theorem or after integration by parts:

(-Py + Qx) dxdy = (-P n2 + Qn1) ds,





where n = (dy/ds, -dx/ds), s arc length, (x(s), y(s)) represents . Assume u is a solution of the initial value problem (4.34)-(4.37) and
suppose that v satisfies M v = 0 in .

where the right hand side is known from given data.

A function v = v(x, y; x0, y0) satisfying (4.42)-(4.45) is called Riemann's function.

Remark. Set w(x, y) = v(x, y; x0, y0) for fixed x0, y0. Then (4.42)-(4.45) imply

where  = -/(2), we arrive at

.

Stretching the axis and transform the equation to the normal form we get finally the following equation, the new function is denoted by u and the new variables are denoted by x, y again,

uxy + cu = 0, with a positive constant c. We make the ansatz for a Riemann function

and obtain

v(x, y; x0, y0) = w(s), s = (x - x0)(y - y0) sw + w + cw = 0.

4.5. INITIAL-BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS

125

 Substitution  = 4cs leads to Bessel's differential equation

2z () + z () + 2z() = 0,

where z() = w(2/(4c)). A solution is

J0() = J0 4c(x - x0)(y - y0)

which defines a Riemann function since J0(0) = 1.
Remark. Bessel's differential equation is
x2y (x) + xy (x) + (x2 - n2)y(x) = 0,
where n  R. If n  N  {0}, then solutions are given by Bessel functions. One of the two linearly independent solutions is bounded at 0. This bounded solution is the Bessel function Jn(x) of first kind and of order n, see [1], for example.

4.5 Initial-boundary value problems
In previous sections we looked at solutions defined for all x  Rn and t  R. In this and in the following section we seek solutions u(x, t) defined in a bounded domain   Rn and for all t  R and which satisfy additional boundary conditions on .

4.5.1 Oscillation of a string
Let u(x, t), x  [a, b], t  R, be the deflection of a string, see Figure 1.4 from Chapter 1. Assume the deflection occurs in the (x, u)-plane. This problem is governed by the initial-boundary value problem

utt(x, t) = uxx(x, t) on (0, l) u(x, 0) = f (x) ut(x, 0) = g(x) u(0, t) = u(l, t) = 0.

(4.46) (4.47) (4.48) (4.49)

Assume the initial data f , g are sufficiently regular. This implies compatibility conditions f (0) = f (l) = 0 and g(0) = g(l).

126

CHAPTER 4. HYPERBOLIC EQUATIONS

Fourier's method

To find solutions of differential equation (4.46) we make the separation of variables ansatz
u(x, t) = v(x)w(t).
Inserting the ansatz into (4.46) we obtain

v(x)w (t) = v (x)w(t),

or, if v(x)w(t) = 0,

w (t) w(t)

=

v (x) v(x)

.

It follows, provided v(x)w(t) is a solution of differential equation (4.46) and

v(x)w(t) = 0,

w (t) w(t)

=

const.

=:

-

and

v (x) v(x)

=

-

since x, t are independent variables. Assume v(0) = v(l) = 0, then v(x)w(t) satisfies the boundary condi-
tion (4.49). Thus we look for solutions of the eigenvalue problem

-v (x) = v(x) in (0, l) v(0) = v(l) = 0,

(4.50) (4.51)

which has the eigenvalues

n =

 l

n

,

n = 1, 2, . . . ,

and associated eigenfunctions are

vn = sin

Solutions of are Set

-w (t) = nw(t) sin( nt), cos( nt). wn(t) = n cos( nt) + n sin( nt),

4.5. INITIAL-BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS

127

where n, n  R. It is easily seen that wn(t)vn(x) is a solution of differential equation (4.46), and, since (4.46) is linear and homogeneous, also (principle of superposition)
N
uN = wn(t)vn(x)
n=1
which satisfies the differential equation (4.46) and the boundary conditions (4.49). Consider the formal solution of (4.46), (4.49)



u(x, t) =

n cos( nt) + n sin( nt) sin

n=1

nx .

(4.52)

"Formal" means that we know here neither that the right hand side converges nor that it is a solution of the initial-boundary value problem. Formally, the unknown coefficients can be calculated from initial conditions (4.47), (4.48) as follows. We have


u(x, 0) = n sin( nx) = f (x).
n=1
 Multiplying this equation by sin( kx) and integrate over (0, l), we get

l

Then

that

(4.54)

Under additional assumptions f  C04(0, l), g  C03(0, l) it follows that the right hand side of (4.52), where n, n are given by (4.53) and (4.54),

128

CHAPTER 4. HYPERBOLIC EQUATIONS

respectively, defines a classical solution of (4.46)-(4.49) since under these
assumptions the series for u and the formal differentiate series for ut, utt, ux, uxx converges uniformly on 0  x  l, 0  t  T , 0 < T <  fixed, see an exercise.

4.5.2 Oscillation of a membrane

Let   R2 be a bounded domain. We consider the initial-boundary value problem

utt(x, t) = xu in  × R, u(x, 0) = f (x), x  , ut(x, 0) = g(x), x  , u(x, t) = 0 on  × R.

(4.55) (4.56) (4.57) (4.58)

As in the previous subsection for the string, we make the ansatz (separation of variables)
u(x, t) = w(t)v(x)
which leads to the eigenvalue problem

- v = v in , v = 0 on .

(4.59) (4.60)

Let n are the eigenvalues of (4.59), (4.60) and vn a complete associated orthonormal system of eigenfunctions. We assume  is sufficiently regular such that the eigenvalues are countable, which is satisfied in the following examples. Then the formal solution of the above initial-boundary value problem is



u(x, t) =

n cos( nt) + n sin( nt) vn(x),

n=1

where

n =

f (x)vn(x) dx



n

=

1 n

g(x)vn(x) dx.


Remark. In general, eigenvalues of (4.59), (4.59) are not known explicitly. There are numerical methods to calculate these values. In some special cases, see next examples, these values are known.

4.5. INITIAL-BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS

Examples

1. Rectangle membrane. Let

u(R, ) = 0,

(4.61) (4.62)

here is u = u(r, ) := v(r cos , r sin ). We will find eigenvalues and eigenfunctions by separation of variables

u(r, ) = v(r)q(),

where v(R) = 0 and q() is periodic with period 2 since u(r, ) is single valued. This leads to

-

(4.63)

which implies

q () q()

-µ.

130

CHAPTER 4. HYPERBOLIC EQUATIONS

Thus, we arrive at the eigenvalue problem

-q () = µq() q() = q( + 2).

It follows that eigenvalues µ are real and nonnegative. All solutions of the differential equation are given by
q() = A sin(µ) + B cos(µ),

where A, B are arbitrary real constants. From the periodicity requirement A sin(µ) + B cos(µ) = A sin(µ( + 2)) + B cos(µ( + 2))

it follows2 sin(µ) (A cos(µ + µ) - B sin(µ + µ)) = 0,

which implies, since A, B are not zero simultaneously, because we are looking for q not identically zero,
sin(µ) sin(µ + ) = 0

for all  and a  = (A, B, µ). Consequently the eigenvalues are

µn = n2, n = 0, 1, . . . .

Inserting q ()/q() = -n2 into (4.63), we obtain the boundary value problem

r2v (r) + rv (r) + (r2 - n2)v = 0 on (0, R)

v(R) = 0

sup |v(r)| < .

where z > 0. Solutions of this differential equations which are bounded at zero are Bessel functions of first kind and n-th order Jn(z). The eigenvalues follows from boundary condition (4.65), i. e., from Jn( R) = 0. Denote by nk the zeros of Jn(z), then the eigenvalues of (4.61)-(4.61) are

nk =

nk 2 R

and the associated eigenfunctions are

Jn( nkr) sin(n), Jn( nkr) cos(n),

n = 1, 2, . . . n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

Thus the eigenvalues 0k are simple and nk, n  1, are double eigenvalues.

Remark. For tables with zeros of Jn(x) and for much more properties of Bessel functions see [25]. One has, in particular, the asymptotic formula

Jn(x) =

2 1/2 x

cos(x - n/2 - /5) + O

as x  . It follows from this formula that there are infinitely many zeros of Jn(x).

4.5.3 Inhomogeneous wave equations
Let   Rn be a bounded and sufficiently regular domain. In this section we consider the initial-boundary value problem

utt = Lu + f (x, t) in  × R u(x, 0) = (x) x  
ut(x, 0) = (x) x   u(x, t) = 0 for x   and t  Rn,

(4.67) (4.68) (4.69) (4.70)

where u = u(x, t), x = (x1, . . . , xn), f, ,  are given and L is an elliptic differential operator. Examples for L are:
1. L = 2/x2, oscillating string.

2. L = x, oscillating membrane.

where Aij = Aji are given sufficiently regular (m × m)-matrices on . We assume that L defines an elliptic system. An example for this case is the linear elasticity.

Consider the eigenvalue problem

(4.71) (4.72)

Assume there are infinitely many eigenvalues

0 < 1  2  . . .  

and a system of associated eigenfunctions v1, v2, . . . which is complete and orthonormal in L2(). This assumption is satisfied if  is bounded and if  is sufficiently regular.
For the solution of (4.67)-(4.70) we make the ansatz


u(x, t) = vk(x)wk(t),
k=1

(4.73)

with functions wk(t) which will be determined later. It is assumed that all series are convergent and that following calculations make sense. Let

be Fourier's decomposition of f with respect to the eigenfunctions vk. We have

ck(t) = f (x, t)vk(x) dx,


(4.75)

Set

then

are Fourier's decomposition of  and , respectively.
In the following we will determine wk(t), which occurs in ansatz (4.73), from the requirement that u = vk(x)wk(t) is a solution of

utt = Lu + ck(t)vk(x)

and that the initial conditions

wk(0) = , vk , wk(0) = , vk are satisfied. From the above differential equation it follows

Thus

wk(t) = -kwk(t) + ck(t).

wk(t) = ak cos( kt) + bk sin( kt)

CHAPTER 4. HYPERBOLIC EQUATIONS

Proposition 4.2. The (formal) solution of the initial-boundary value problem (4.67)-(4.70) is given by

u(x, t) = vk(x)wk(t),
k=1
where vk is a complete orthonormal system of eigenfunctions of (4.71), (4.72) and the functions wk are defined by (4.76).

The resonance phenomenon
Set in (4.67)-(4.70)  = 0,  = 0 and assume that the external force f is periodic and is given by

f (x, t) = A sin(t)vn(x),

where A,  are real constants and vn is one of the eigenfunctions of (4.71), (4.72). It follows
ck(t) = f (x, t)vk(x) dx = Ank sin(t).

Then the solution of the initial value problem (4.67)-(4.70) is

Consequently |u| can be arbitrarilylarge at some points x and at some times t if  = n. The frequencies n are called critical frequencies at

which resonance occurs.

A uniqueness result
The solution of of the initial-boundary value problem (4.67)-(4.70) is unique in the class C2( × R).

4.5. INITIAL-BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS

135

Proof. Let u1, u2 are two solutions, then u = u2 - u1 satisfies

utt = Lu in  × R u(x, 0) = 0 x  
ut(x, 0) = 0 x   u(x, t) = 0 for x   and t  Rn.

As an example we consider Example 3 from above and set

n
E(t) = ( aij(x)uxi uxj + utut) dx.
 i,j=1

Then

n
E (t) = 2 ( aij(x)uxi uxjt + ututt) dx

= 0.

It follows E(t) = const. From ut(x, 0) = 0 and u(x, 0) = 0 we get E(0) = 0.

Consequently E(t) = 0 for all t, which implies, since L is elliptic, that

u(x, t) = const. on  × R. Finally, the homogeneous initial and boundary

value conditions lead to u(x, t) = 0 on  × R.

Parabolic equations

Here we consider linear parabolic equations of second order. An example is the heat equation
ut = a2 u,
where u = u(x, t), x  R3, t  0, and a2 is a positive constant called conductivity coefficient. The heat equation has its origin in physics where u(x, t) is the temperature at x at time t, see [20], p. 394, for example.

Remark 1. After scaling of axis we can assume a = 1.

Remark 2. By setting t := -t, the heat equation changes to an equation which is called backward equation. This is the reason for the fact that the heat equation describes irreversible processes in contrast to the wave equation 2u = 0 which is invariant with respect the mapping t  -t. Mathematically, it means that it is not possible, in general, to find the distribution of temperature at an earlier time t < t0 if the distribution is given at t0.
Consider the initial value problem for u = u(x, t), u  C(Rn × R+),

ut = u in x  Rn, t  0, u(x, 0) = (x),

2. u(x, t) defined by Poisson's formula depends on all values (y), y  Rn. That means, a perturbation of , even far from a fixed x, has influence to the value u(x, t). In physical terms, this means that heat travels with infinite speed, in contrast to the experience.

n
uxlxk (x0, t0)lk  0 for all   Rn.

The previous inequality implies that uxkxk (x0, t0)  0 for each k. Thus we arrived at a contradiction to ut - u < 0 in DT .

CHAPTER 6. PARABOLIC EQUATIONS

Case (ii). Assume (x0, t0)  ×{T -}. Then it follows as above u  0 in (x0, t0), and from u(x0, t0)  u(x0, t), t  t0, one concludes that ut(x0, t0)  0. We arrived at a contradiction to ut - u < 0 in DT again.

Summarizing, we have shown that

max u(x, t) = max u(x, t).

Thus there is an (x, t)  ST - such that

v(x, t) := u(x, t) - kt,

If we replace in the above theorem the bounded domain  by Rn, then the result remains true provided we assume an additional growth assumption for u. More precisely, we have the following result which is a corollary of the previous theorem. Set for a fixed T , 0 < T < ,

DT = {(x, t) : x  Rn, 0 < t < T }.

Proposition 6.2. Assume u  C(DT ), that ut, uxixk exist and are continuous in DT ,
ut - u  0 in DT ,

Proof of Proposition 6.2. See [10], pp. 217. We can assume that 4aT < 1, since the finite interval can be divided into finite many intervals of equal length  with 4a < 1. Then we conclude successively for k that

6.4 Initial-boundary value problem

Consider the initial-boundary value problem for c = c(x, t)

ct = D c in  × (0, )

c(x, 0) = c0(x) x  

c n

=

0 on  × (0, ).

(6.5) (6.6)
(6.7)

Here is   Rn, n the exterior unit normal at the smooth parts of , D a positive constant and c0(x) a given function.

Remark. In application to diffusion problems, c(x, t) is the concentration of a substance in a solution, c0(x) its initial concentration and D the coefficient of diffusion. First Fick's rule says that w = Dc/n, where w is the flow of the substance through the boundary . Thus according to the Neumann boundary condition (6.7), we assume that there is no flow through the boundary.

6.4.1 Fourier's method
Separation of variables ansatz c(x, t) = v(x)w(t) leads to the eigenvalue problem, see the arguments of Section 4.5,

- v = v in 

v n

=

0 on ,

and to the ordinary differential equation

(6.8) (6.9)

w (t) + Dw(t) = 0.

(6.10)

Assume  is bounded and  sufficiently regular, then the eigenvalues of (6.8), (6.9) are countable and

0 = 0 < 1  2  . . .  .
Let vj(x) be a complete system of orthonormal (in L2()) eigenfunctions. Solutions of (6.10) are
wj (t) = Cj e-Djt,
where Cj are arbitrary constants.

6.4. INITIAL-BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEM

163

According to the superposition principle,
N
cN (x, t) := Cje-Djtvj(x)
j=0
is a solution of the differential equation (6.8) and

c(x, t) := Cje-Djtvj(x),
j=0
with Cj = c0(x)vj(x) dx,

is a formal solution of the initial-boundary value problem (6.5)-(6.7).

164

CHAPTER 6. PARABOLIC EQUATIONS

Set z = x3, then the above initial-boundary value problem reduces to

ct = Dczz c(z, 0) = c0(z)
cz = 0, z = 0, z = l.

6.5 Black-Scholes equation

Solutions of the Black-Scholes equation define the value of a derivative, for example of a call or put option, which is based on an asset. An asset

6.5. BLACK-SCHOLES EQUATION

can be a stock or a derivative again, for example. In principle, there are infinitely many such products, for example n-th derivatives. The BlackScholes equation for the value V (S, t) of a derivative is

and , r are positive constants. More precisely,  is the volatility of the underlying asset S, r is the guaranteed interest rate of a risk-free investment.
If S(t) is the value of an asset at time t, then V (S(t), t) is the value of the derivative at time t, where V (S, t) is the solution of an appropriate initial-boundary value problem for the Black-Scholes equation, see below.
The Black-Scholes equation follows from Ito's Lemma under some assumptions on the random function associated to S(t), see [26], for example.

Call option

Here is V (S, t) := C(S, t), where C(S, t) is the value of the (European) call option. In this case we have following side conditions to (6.11):

C(S, T ) = max{S - E, 0} C(0, t) = 0 C(S, t) = S + o(S) as S  , uniformly in t,

(6.12) (6.13) (6.14)

where E and T are positive constants, E is the exercise price and T the expiry.

Side condition (6.12) means that the value of the option has no value at time T if S(T )  E, condition (6.13) says that it makes no sense to buy assets if the value of the asset is zero, condition (6.14) means that we buy assets if its value becomes large, see Figure 6.5, where the side conditions are indicated.

Theorem 6.4 (Black-Scholes formula for European call options). The solution C(S, t), 0  S < , 0  t  T , of the initial-boundary value problem (6.11)-(6.14) is explicitly known and is given by
C(S, t) = SN (d1) - Ee-r(T -t)N (d2),

For a solution of (6.15) we make the ansatz v = ex+ u(x,  ),

6.5. BLACK-SCHOLES EQUATION

where  and  are constants which we will determine as follows. Inserting the ansatz into differential equation (6.15), we get

u + u = 2u + 2ux + uxx + (k - 1)(u + ux) - ku.

Set  = 2 + (k - 1) - k and choose  such that 0 = 2 + (k - 1), then u = uxx. Thus

v(x,  ) = e-(k-1)x/2-(k+1)2/4u(x,  ),

(6.17)

where u(x,  ) is a solution of the initial value problem

u = uxx, - < x < ,  > 0 u(x, 0) = u0(x),

with

u0(x) = max e(k+1)x/2 - e(k-1)x/2, 0 .

Combining the formula for u(x,  ), definition (6.17) of v(x,  ) and the previous settings x = ln(S/E),  = 2(T - t)/2 and C = Ev(x,  ), we get finally
the formula of of Theorem 6.4.

In general, the solution u of the initial value problem for the heat equation is not uniquely defined, see for example [10], pp. 206.
Uniqueness. The uniqueness follows from the growth assumption (6.14). Assume there are two solutions of (6.11), (6.12)-(6.14), then the difference W (S, t) satisfies the differential equation (6.11) and the side conditions

W (S, T ) = 0, W (0, t) = 0, W (S, t) = O(S) as S  

uniformly in 0  t  T .
From a maximum principle consideration, see an exercise, it follows that |W (S, t)|  cS on S  0, 0  t  T . The constant c is independent on S and t. From the definition of u we see that

u(x,  )

=

1 E

e-x-

W

(S,

t),

where S = Eex, t = T - 2 /(2). Thus we have the growth property

|u(x,  )|  M ea|x|, x  R,

(6.18)

with positive constants M and a. Then the solution of u = uxx, in - < x < , 0    2T /2, with the initial condition u(x, 0) = 0 is uniquely

defined in the class of functions satisfying the growth condition (6.18), see

Proposition 6.2 of this chapter. That is, u(x,  )  0.

Put option
Here is V (S, t) := P (S, t), where P (S, t) is the value of the (European) put option. In this case we have following side conditions to (6.11):

P (S, T ) = max{E - S, 0} P (0, t) = Ee-r(T -t) P (S, t) = o(S) as S  , uniformly in 0  t  T.

(6.19) (6.20) (6.21)

Here E is the exercise price and T the expiry.

Side condition (6.19) means that the value of the option has no value at time T if S(T )  E, condition (6.20) says that it makes no sense to sell assets if the value of the asset is zero, condition (6.21) means that it makes no sense to sell assets if its value becomes large.

Theorem 6.5 (Black-Scholes formula for European put options). The solution P (S, t), 0 < S < , t < T of the initial-boundary value problem (6.11), (6.19)-(6.21) is explicitly known and is given by
P (S, t) = Ee-r(T -t)N (-d2) - SN (-d1)

where N (x), d1, d2 are the same as in Theorem 6.4.

Proof. The formula for the put option follows by the same calculations as in the case of a call option or from the put-call parity
C(S, t) - P (S, t) = S - Ee-r(T -t)

and from

N (x) + N (-x) = 1.

Concerning the put-call parity see an exercise. See also [26], pp. 40, for a heuristic argument which leads to the formula for the put-call parity. 2

Elliptic equations of second order

Here we consider linear elliptic equations of second order, mainly the Laplace equation
u = 0.

Solutions of the Laplace equation are called potential functions or harmonic
functions. The Laplace equation is called also potential equation. The general elliptic equation for a scalar function u(x), x    Rn, is

Definition. A function

is called fundamental solution associated to the Laplace equation if   C2() and x = 0 for each fixed y  .
Remark. The fundamental solution  satisfies for each fixed y   the relation

In the following we assume that , the function  which appears in the definition of the fundamental solution and the potential function u considered are sufficiently regular such that the following calculations make sense, see [6] for generalizations.

7.2.1 Conclusions from the representation formula
Similar to the theory of functions of one complex variable, we obtain here results for harmonic functions from the representation formula, in particular from (7.2), (7.3). We recall that a function u is called harmonic if u  C2() and u = 0 in .
Proposition 7.1. Assume u is harmonic in . Then u  C().

Proof. Let 0   be a domain such that y  0. It follows from representation formulas (7.2), (7.3), where  := 0, that Dlu(y) exist and

180

CHAPTER 7. ELLIPTIC EQUATIONS OF SECOND ORDER

are continuous for all l since one can change differentiation with integration

in right hand sides of the representation formulae.

Remark. In fact, a function which is harmonic in  is even real analytic in , see an exercise.

We recall that a domain   Rn is called connected if  is not the union of two nonempty open subsets 1, 2 such that 1  2 = . A domain in Rn is connected if and only if its path connected.

Proposition 7.3 (Maximum principle). Assume u is harmonic in a connected domain and achieves its supremum or infimum in . Then u  const. in .

Proof. Consider the case of the supremum. Let x0   such that
u(x0) = sup u(x) =: M.

Set 1 := {x   : u(x) = M } and 2 := {x   : u(x) < M }. The set 1 is not empty since x0  1. The set 2 is open since u  C2(). Consequently, 2 is empty if we can show that 1 is open. Let x  1, then there is a 0 > 0 such that B0(x)   and u(x) = M for all x  B0(x).

7.3. BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS

If not, then there exists  > 0 and x such that |x - x| = , 0 <  < 0 and u(x) < M . From the mean value formula, see Proposition 7.2, it follows

M

1 nn-1

B(x)

u(x) dS <

dS = M,

which is a contradiction. Thus, the set 2 is empty since 1 is open. 2

Corollary. Assume  is connected and bounded, and u  C2()  C() is harmonic in . Then u achieves its minimum and its maximum on the boundary .

Remark. The previous corollary fails if  is not bounded as simple counterexamples show.

7.3 Boundary value problems
Assume   Rn is a connected domain.

The Dirichlet problem (first boundary value problem) is to find a solution u  C2()  C() of

Proposition 7.4. Assume  is bounded, then a solution to the Dirichlet problem is uniquely determined.

Proof. Maximum principle.

Remark. The previous result fails if we take away in the boundary condi-
tion (7.5) one point from the the boundary as the following example shows. Let   R2 be the domain

7.4 Green's function for

Theorem 7.1 says that each harmonic function satisfies

u(x) =



(y,

x)

u(y) ny

-

u(y)

(y, x) ny

dSy ,

(7.10)

where (y, x) is a fundamental solution. In general, u does not satisfies the boundary condition in the above boundary value problems. Since  = s + , see Section 7.2, where  is an arbitrary harmonic function for each fixed x, we try to find a  such that u satisfies also the boundary condition.
Consider the Dirichlet problem, then we look for a  such that

(y, x) = 0, y  , x  .

(7.11)

Then

u(x) = -



(y, x) ny

u(y)

dSy ,

x  .

184

CHAPTER 7. ELLIPTIC EQUATIONS OF SECOND ORDER

Suppose that u achieves its boundary values  of the Dirichlet problem, then

u(x) = -



(y, x) ny

(y)

dSy ,

(7.12)

We claim that this function solves the Dirichlet problem (7.4), (7.5).
A function (y, x) which satisfies (7.11), and some additional assumptions, is called Green's function. More precisely, we define a Green function as follows.

Definition. A function G(y, x), y, x  , x = y, is called Green function associated to  and to the Dirichlet problem (7.4), (7.5) if for fixed x  , that is we consider G(y, x) as a function of y, the following properties hold:

(i) G(y, x)  C2( \ {x})  C( \ {x}), (ii) G(y, x) - s(|x - y|)  C2()  C(). (iii) G(y, x) = 0 if y  , x = y.

yG(y, x) = 0, x = y.

Remark. We will see in the next section that a Green function exists at least for some domains of simple geometry. Concerning the existence of a Green function for more general domains see [13].

It is an interesting fact that we get from (i)-(iii) of the above definition two further important properties. We assume that  is bounded, sufficiently regular and connected.

Proposition 7.7. A Green function has the following properties. In the case n = 2 we assume diam  < 1.

(A) G(x, y) = G(y, x) (symmetry).

(B) 0 < G(x, y) < s(|x - y|), x, y  , x = y.
Proof. (A) Let x(1), x(2)  . Set Bi = B(x(i)), i = 1, 2. We assume Bi   and B1  B2 = . Since G(y, x(1)) and G(y, x(2)) are harmonic in  \ B1  B2 we obtain from Green's identity, see Figure 7.4 for notations,

(B) Since

186

CHAPTER 7. ELLIPTIC EQUATIONS OF SECOND ORDER

and G(y, x) = 0 if y   and x   we have for y  
(y, x) = -s(|x - y|).
From the definition of s(|x - y|) it follows that (y, x) < 0 if y  . Thus, since y = 0 in , the maximum-minimum principle implies that (y, x) < 0 for all y, x  . Consequently
G(y, x) < s(|x - y|), x, y  , x = y.
It remains to show that
G(y, x) > 0, x, y  , x = y.
Fix x   and let B(x) be a ball such that B(x)   for all 0 <  < 0. There is a sufficiently small 0 > 0 such that for each , 0 <  < 0,
G(y, x) > 0 for all y  B(x), x = y, see property (iii) of a Green function. Since
yG(y, x) = 0 in  \ B(x) G(y, x) > 0 if y  B(x) G(y, x) = 0 if y  
it follows from the maximum-minimum principle that
G(y, x) > 0 on  \ B(x).

7.4.1 Green's function for a ball

If  = BR(0) is a ball, then Green's function is explicitly known. Let  = BR(0) be a ball in Rn with radius R and the center at the
origin. Let x, y  BR(0) and let y the reflected point of y on the sphere BR(0), that is, in particular |y||y | = R2, see Figure 7.5 for notations. Set

(i) H(x, y)  C, |y| = R, |x| < R, x = y,

(ii) xH(x, y) = 0, |x| < R, |y| = R,

(iii) BR(0) H(x, y) dSy = 1, |x| < R, (iv) H(x, y) > 0, |y| = R, |x| < R,

(v) Fix   BR(0) and  > 0, then limx,|x|<R H(x, y) = 0 uniformly in y  BR(0), |y - | > .

It remains to show that u, given by Poisson's formula, is in C(BR(0)) and that u achieves the prescribed boundary values. Fix   BR(0) and let x  BR(0). Then
